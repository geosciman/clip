You want **results**. 你想要结果。

To get the results you want, you need to hold people accountable.  

要想得到你想要的结果，你需要让人们负起责任。

Holding them accountable can only happen through candid feedback.  

只有通过坦诚的反馈，才能让他们负起责任。

And through candid conversation you will build trust.  

通过坦诚的对话，你们将建立起信任。

And once you trust your team members, you are willing to be more generous - perhaps with more flexible working, more holidays etc.  

一旦你信任你的团队成员，你就会愿意更加慷慨，也许是更灵活的工作方式，更多的假期等等。

Whether its this explicit or not, this is how most managers work.  

无论是否明确，这就是大多数管理者的工作方式。

The only problem is, as a way to have motivated, high performing employees, this approach **doesn’t work.**  

唯一的问题是，作为拥有积极进取、高绩效员工的一种方式，这种方法并不奏效。

In fact, it’s completely backwards.  

事实上，这完全是倒退。

Today, I want to share with you a model that **completely changed how I think about professional relationships**.  

今天，我想与大家分享一种模式，它彻底改变了我对职业关系的看法。

It flips this model on it’s head in a way that will change your work relationships forever.  

它颠覆了这一模式，将永远改变你的工作关系。

Let’s get into it 🚀  

让我们开始吧 🚀

Work relationships are often transactional.  

工作关系往往是交易性的。

You give me money, I give you time. But simply giving someone a salary is no guarantee that they are going to work hard, do their best, or take the initiative.  

你给我钱，我给你时间。但是，仅仅给人薪水并不能保证他们会努力工作、尽心尽力或主动出击。

Trends like [‘quiet quitting’](https://www.personio.com/hr-lexicon/quiet-quitting/) are just one of the more egregious examples of what happens when employees are disengaged.  

悄悄辞职 "等趋势只是员工脱离工作的一个更恶劣的例子。

So the timeless challenge, is how to motivate your team.  

因此，永恒的挑战就是如何激励你的团队。

Faced with this question, you might take a number of different approaches.  

面对这个问题，你可能会采取多种不同的方法。

You could try to pay people more. You could try to give them cushy offices with massages and free food and laundry on site etc. You can also try to exhort them about how important “the mission” is. You can try to bribe them with bonuses, or scare them with threats of “personal improvement plans (PIPs)”.  

你可以尝试给人们更高的薪水。你可以给他们舒适的办公室，提供按摩、免费食物和现场洗衣等服务。你还可以劝说他们 "使命 "有多么重要。你可以用奖金来贿赂他们，或者用 "个人改进计划（PIP）"来威胁他们。

All this may make some marginal difference.  

所有这些可能会带来一些微小的变化。

But what is critical is the direct relationship that someone has with their direct superiors.  

但最关键的是一个人与其直接上级的直接关系。

Relationships with management are the [top factor in employees’ job satisfaction](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-boss-factor-making-the-world-a-better-place-through-workplace-relationships), which in turn is the second most important determinant of employees’ overall well-being (after mental health).  

与管理层的关系是影响员工工作满意度的首要因素，而工作满意度又是决定员工整体幸福感的第二大因素（仅次于心理健康）。

A strong relationship can be one of mentorship, mutual personal growth and co-creation.  

一种牢固的关系可以是师徒关系、个人的共同成长和共同创造。

These are the type of relationships we want to strive for.  

这就是我们要努力建立的关系类型。

A poor employee-manager relationship can lead to stress, underperformance, disengagement, and possibly to them quitting.  

员工与管理者关系不佳会导致压力、业绩不佳、离职，甚至可能导致他们辞职。

These relationships will likely make or break the person’s attitude to their work, and be a decisive factor in whether they end up staying in the company long term, or quickly bailing out to the next thing.  

这些关系很可能会决定一个人的工作态度，也是他们最终是长期留在公司，还是迅速跳槽另谋高就的决定性因素。

Given how expensive hiring is, and how much of a difference it makes that employees are engaged at work, this is fundamental for managers to master.  

考虑到招聘成本的高昂以及员工工作投入程度的不同，这是管理者必须掌握的基本技能。

Getting this right can be make or break for your team and your company.  

正确处理好这一点，对团队和公司都有决定性的影响。

And most people get it completely wrong.  

而大多数人都完全搞错了。

Let’s revisit the model we laid out at the beginning of the post.  

让我们重温一下文章开头所描述的模式。

Managers often have an instinct to go straight for **results**. After all, you might reason, this is what we are here to do. We are here to work, to get things done, to achieve things. I just hired you to do a job, so I need results.  

管理者往往有一种直接追求结果的本能。毕竟，你可能会说，这就是我们的工作。我们是来工作的，是来完成任务的，是来成就事业的。我只是雇你来做事的，所以我需要结果。

You say to yourself, “_I need to hold X **accountable** for the standard of their work”_.  

你会对自己说："我需要让 X 对他们的工作标准负责"。

How do I do that, you might wonder?  

你可能会问，我该怎么做呢？

Well, the way you do that is by being candid. Speaking plainly and clearly when things don’t go well. Giving frank and **candid** feedback to improve performance.  

那么，做到这一点的方法就是坦诚。遇到不顺心的事，直截了当地说出来。给予坦诚直率的反馈，以提高绩效。

This makes you feel like you are being a good boss.  

这让你觉得自己是个好老板。

You are managing your direct reports.  

您正在管理您的直接下属。

Once you have established feedback mechanisms, then you feel you can start to **trust** this person to deliver.  

一旦你建立了反馈机制，你就会觉得可以开始信任这个人，相信他能完成任务。

And once you trust them, then you can start to reward them. You can start to be more **generous**. Perhaps you allow them more flexible working for example, or to manage their own time more independently.  

一旦你信任他们，你就可以开始奖励他们。你可以开始更加慷慨。例如，你可以允许他们更灵活地工作，或者更独立地管理自己的时间。

I’m sure that parts of this story will sound familiar to everyone reading this.  

我相信，读到这里的每个人都会对这个故事的某些部分似曾相识。

We have all had managers that have taken this approach.  

我们都曾有过采取这种方法的管理者。

But this approach is **exactly backwards**.  

但这种做法恰恰是倒退的。

Let’s take the story I just told and reverse it.  

让我们把我刚才讲的故事反过来再讲一遍。

You start by leading with **generosity**.  

首先，你要慷慨大方地领导大家。

A habit of generosity builds **trust.**  

慷慨的习惯会建立信任。

When trust is established, it gives you permission for **candour**.  

信任一旦建立，就会允许你坦诚相待。

And candour allows you to hold people **accountable.**  

而坦诚则能让你对他人负责。

With accountability, they will deliver better **results**.  

有了问责制，他们将取得更好的成果。

You see that this is the exact opposite of how managers might typically approach this?  

你看，这与管理者通常的做法完全相反。

This model is called **the relationship ladder**.  

这种模式被称为关系阶梯。

_The best ever drawing of a ladder. Full credit for this framework goes to Andreas at Trim Tab  

有史以来最好的梯子图。此框架完全归功于 Trim Tab 的 Andreas_

Lets take a look at each rung of the ladder.  

让我们来看看阶梯的每个梯级。

We start with this foundation of generosity.  

我们以慷慨为基础。

It could mean taking the time to go for lunch with the new graduate.  

这可能意味着花时间与新毕业生共进午餐。

It could mean supporting a colleague with something they are struggling with.  

这可能意味着在同事遇到困难时为其提供支持。

The important thing is that generosity is in the eye of the receiver. If I gave my uncle a book on AI, he probably would be more confused than grateful. But instead if I gave him a book on architecture, he would likely consider it generous.  

重要的是，慷慨与否取决于接受者的眼光。如果我给我叔叔一本关于人工智能的书，他可能会感到困惑而不是感激。但相反，如果我给他一本关于建筑学的书，他可能会认为这是慷慨之举。

Generosity is in the eye of the receiver.  

慷慨是接受者的眼睛。

Once you have led with generosity, you start to establish trust. I start to believe that you have my best interests at heart, that I can trust you.  

一旦你慷慨地引导了别人，你就开始建立信任。我开始相信你是为我好，我可以信任你。

From there, you gain permission for candour. How many of us have had people say some candid stuff to you that you felt hurt or offended by? All of us. If I get unthinking feedback from someone I barely know, I am unlikely to take it well. But if a trusted friend or colleague says to me “_hey I think you could have done x, y, z better_”, I’m going to listen and take what they are saying more seriously.  

这样，你就能获得坦率的许可。我们当中有多少人曾对你说过一些坦率的话，让你觉得受到伤害或冒犯？我们所有人都有过。如果我从一个几乎不认识的人那里得到不假思索的反馈，我不太可能接受。但是，如果一个值得信赖的朋友或同事对我说："嘿，我觉得你本可以把 x、y、z 做得更好"，我就会认真倾听和对待他们所说的话。

Once you have trust, and you are able to speak more candidly in your work relationships, it allows you to hold people accountable.  

一旦有了信任，你就能在工作关系中更坦率地说话，这让你能够让别人对你负责。

Accountability is the foundation of results.  

问责制是取得成果的基础。

Of course results is where you want to get to. But you can’t skip any of the rungs along the way.  

结果当然是你想要的。但你不能跳过途中的任何一个阶段。

You have to start from the bottom of the ladder with each new relationship. You can’t skip to results. You can’t skip straight to candour. This will backfire.  

在每一段新的关系中，你都必须从最底层做起。你不能跳到结果。不能直接跳到坦诚。这会适得其反。

Instead, use the relationship ladder to totally rethink how you approach your work relationships, how you approach managing your team.  

相反，利用关系阶梯来重新思考如何处理工作关系，如何管理团队。

And even though this approach will allow you to get the most out of work relationships this is also a fantastic framework for how to think about any relationship, whether across your organisation, someone you are trying to sell to, or even in your personal life.  

尽管这种方法可以让你在工作关系中获得最大收益，但它也是一个非常好的框架，可以用来思考任何关系，无论是在你的组织中，还是在你试图推销的对象身上，甚至是在你的个人生活中。

Ok so the things you might want to hold someone accountable for at work, and the results you might want in your personal life will be quite different.  

好吧，你在工作中可能想让别人对你负责的事情，和你在个人生活中可能想要的结果是完全不同的。

But I still find this framework incredibly helpful, even if it’s just **starting with generosity as a foundation to all my relationships**.  

但我仍然觉得这个框架非常有用，哪怕只是把慷慨作为我所有人际关系的基础。

So remember the Relationship Ladder:  

因此，请记住 "关系阶梯"：

**Generosity → Trust → Candour → Accountability → Results  

慷慨 → 信任 → 坦诚 → 问责 → 成果**

I found this framework totally changed how I approached my relationships at work.  

我发现这个框架完全改变了我在工作中处理人际关系的方式。

I hope you also found it useful.  

希望你也能从中受益。

Until next time, 下次再见
