I often write about amazing things I read in books. But sometimes I feel the need to write about things I haven't read in a book, because I have failed to find a book that should exist.  

我经常写我在书中读到的奇妙事物。但有时我觉得有必要写一些我在书中没有读到的东西，因为我没有找到一本应该存在的书。

The question why some societies require men to pay brideprices while other societies require women to bring a dowry to a union is one of those questions. There should be a good book somewhere that explains this.   

为什么有些社会要求男性支付聘礼，而另一些社会则要求女性在结婚时携带嫁妆，这就是其中的一个问题。应该有一本好书可以解释这个问题。

I haven’t found that good book. There is a book from 1971, _Bridewealth and Dowry_ by Jack Goody and Stanley J Tambiah. It builds on economist [Esther Boserup's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester_Boserup) theory that there is a strong correlation between dowry and plow agriculture (predominantly run by men) and brideprice and hoe agriculture (predominantly run by women). And there are a number of more or less obscure papers. But I miss _the_ explanation to why resources sometimes flow from the families of women to the new household (dowry) and sometimes from the groom or the groom's family to the wife's family (brideprice).   

我还没找到那本好书。1971 年，杰克-古迪（Jack Goody）和斯坦利-J-坦比亚（Stanley J Tambiah）合著了一本名为《新娘财富与嫁妆》的书。这本书以经济学家埃丝特-博瑟鲁普的理论为基础，即嫁妆与犁耕农业（主要由男性经营）和聘金与锄耕农业（主要由女性经营）之间存在密切的相关性。还有一些或多或少晦涩难懂的论文。但我不知道为什么资源有时从妇女的家庭流向新家庭（嫁妆），有时从新郎或新郎的家庭流向妻子的家庭（聘礼）。

For that reason, I'm writing yet another blog post on a subject that really merits a book: The link between population density and marriage payments. It is a messy subject with loads of data and details. Giving it any justice would require a book. Since I don't have the time to write that book or any resources to market it, I only analyze the most obvious patterns.  

为此，我又写了一篇博文，论述一个真正值得一书的主题：人口密度与结婚率之间的联系。这是一个杂乱无章的话题，有大量的数据和细节。要公正地对待这个问题，需要写一本书。由于我没有时间写这本书，也没有资源去推销它，所以我只分析最明显的模式。

I use the terms brideprice for the custom of buying a woman from her family for marriage. I use the term dowry for the custom that a woman's family makes a contribution to the household their daughter forms with a man. Historically, brideprice and dowry were not equivalents. A brideprice was paid to a woman's family. It was commonly used to buy wives for the bride's male family members. A dowry was a form of early inheritance paid at the time of the wedding. The purpose of the dowry was to enrich the household of which a daughter would be part to the benefit of the dowry-payers' grandchildren.   

我用 "聘礼"（brideprice）一词来表示从女方家庭购买女子结婚的习俗。我用嫁妆一词来指妇女的家庭为其女儿与男子组成的家庭提供捐助的习俗。历史上，聘礼和嫁妆并不等同。聘礼是付给女方家庭的。通常用于为新娘的男性家庭成员购买妻子。嫁妆是在婚礼上支付的一种提前继承的形式。嫁妆的目的是让女儿所在的家庭富裕起来，使嫁妆支付者的子孙受益。

Nowadays, the word "dowry" is heavily connected to modern-day India, where parents started to demand a kind of groomprice for the human capital invested in a son. This is a late-day phenomenon of a post-agricultural society that kept some agricultural customs. It is not at all typical in history, not even in the history of India itself.

More about that further down.  

如今，"嫁妆 "一词与现代印度有着千丝万缕的联系，在印度，父母开始为儿子的人力资本投资索取一种新郎价格。这是保留了一些农业习俗的后农业社会的晚期现象。在历史上，甚至在印度本身的历史上，这都不是典型的现象。1 下文将对此做进一步介绍。

First of all: According to economic theory, prices are set by supply and demand. For that reason I'm feeling a bit annoyed with the fairness assumption behind much of the thinking around the marriage transfer question. For example, it is said that virilocal societies where women do a lot of agricultural work tend to be brideprice societies, because losing the labor of a daughter is seen as a cost that needs to be compensated.

The way that theory is formulated makes me wonder: Since when do human societies strive for fairness? The reason why human societies tend to be unfair one way or the other is that people seldom give resources away when they can avoid it. If men pay for women, they probably do so because they need to make a bid to compete with other men for relatively scarce women.  

首先是价格：根据经济学理论，价格是由供求关系决定的。因此，我对许多围绕婚姻转让问题的思考背后的公平假设感到有些恼火。例如，有人说，妇女从事大量农活的男权社会往往是以嫁妆为代价的社会，因为失去女儿的劳动力被视为一种需要补偿的成本。2 这一理论的表述方式让我感到疑惑：人类社会什么时候开始追求公平了？人类社会之所以会出现这样或那样的不公平现象，是因为人们在可以避免的情况下很少将资源拱手相让。如果男人为女人付钱，他们这样做可能是因为他们需要出价与其他男人竞争相对稀缺的女人。

Then the question becomes: Why would the supply and demand of women vary between societies? Why are there sometimes so few women that parents are paid to raise them, and sometimes so many women that parents need to sugar-coat them with resources to make them attractive enough as marriage partners?  

那么问题就来了：为什么不同社会的妇女供需会有所不同？为什么有时女性很少，以至于父母要花钱抚养她们，而有时女性很多，以至于父母需要用资源来为她们涂脂抹粉，使她们成为足够吸引人的结婚对象？

There is no reason to question Esther Boserup's observation that hoe agriculture societies that rely on female agricultural labor mostly practice brideprice and plow agriculture societies that rely on male agricultural labor are more keen on practicing dowry. The interesting question is: _Why_ do some societies practice hoe agriculture and other practice plow agriculture?  

埃丝特-博瑟鲁普认为，依靠女性农业劳动力的锄耕农业社会大多实行聘礼，而依靠男性农业劳动力的犁耕农业社会则更热衷于实行嫁妆。有趣的问题是：为什么一些社会实行锄耕农业，而另一些社会实行犁耕农业？

I think the answer is population density. As long as men can, they will employ women to do most of the hard and dirty work. As long as it is possible for a man to use martial prowess and social skills to amass a harem of wives who will sustain themselves and their children with their work, the men who focus on exactly that will win the evolutionary race. The men who peacefully focus on feeding the children they have with one woman will not be the most successful.  

我认为答案就是人口密度。只要男人有能力，他们就会雇佣女人干大部分苦活和脏活。只要男人有可能利用武艺和社交技巧聚敛一帮妻子，让她们用自己的劳动来养活自己和孩子，那么专注于此的男人就会在进化竞赛中获胜。而那些只专注于养活自己和一个女人所生孩子的男人则不会是最成功的。

As long as mortality among adults and children is high enough, having too many children is not a problem. Sons can try their luck as warriors. Under very primitive conditions, they can raid the neighbors and steal a wife. Under somewhat less primitive conditions, they can raid the neighbors and steal cattle and buy a wife. Daughters, if they can be protected from those neighbors long enough, can be exchanged for new wives to their brothers or fathers.  

只要成人和儿童的死亡率足够高，生太多孩子就不是问题。儿子们可以试试当战士的运气。在非常原始的条件下，他们可以袭击邻居并偷一个妻子。在不那么原始的条件下，他们可以袭击邻居，偷牛买妻子。女儿们如果能得到足够长的保护，不被邻居抢走，就可以换给自己的兄弟或父亲做新媳妇。

As long as feeding children is not a major concern for men, they will benefit from having as many as possible. In such an environment they will want as many wives as possible. For that reason, there will be a great demand for women of marriageable age. They will be bargained for, kidnapped and sold, in every society with anything to buy and sell.  

只要喂养孩子不是男人的主要关切，他们就会从尽可能多的孩子中受益。在这样的环境下，他们会想要尽可能多的妻子。因此，对适婚年龄女性的需求会非常大。在任何一个可以买卖任何东西的社会里，她们都会被讨价还价、绑架和贩卖。

The great demand for females will make them difficult to protect. Which will make them costly to raise. Managing to protect a daughter until her reproductive years is rewarded with a brideprice. That brideprice can be used to pay for buying the protected daughters of other people.  

对雌性动物的大量需求将使它们难以得到保护。这将使她们的养育成本高昂。如果能保护一个女儿到生育年龄，就能得到一笔过桥费。这个聘金可以用来购买其他人受保护的女儿。

The only reason why this system didn't last forever, everywhere, is that eventually, societies somehow got more peaceful. Mortality became lower and the population increased. Which made land a scarce resource. Extensive hoe agriculture by women was no longer efficient enough to sustain children - it required too much land. In such an environment, men face a choice: See their children succumb or work harder themselves. Those who chose the latter became evolutionarily successful. Plowing with animals is hard work and requires the upper body strength of a man. But it gives more output from a given area. When land became scarce, the men who were prepared to work their limited amount of land themselves got more surviving children.  

这种制度之所以没有在任何地方永远持续下去，唯一的原因是，社会最终以某种方式变得更加和平。死亡率降低，人口增加。这使得土地成为稀缺资源。妇女们广泛的锄头农业不再有效率，无法养活孩子，因为它需要太多的土地。在这样的环境中，男人们面临着一个选择：眼看着自己的孩子屈服，还是自己更加努力地工作。选择后者的人在进化中取得了成功。与动物一起耕地是一项艰苦的工作，需要人的上半身力量。但它能在一定面积上获得更多的产出。当土地变得稀缺时，那些准备自己耕种有限土地的人就会有更多的孩子存活下来。

For those plowmen, wives weren't as useful anymore. They still needed one wife to give them a number of children to provide for. But since they had to provide for all children with their own labor, they had no interest in having an infinite number of children. For that reason, most men stopped bargaining for additional wives. Women who gave birth to children _and_ provided for those children themselves were simply much more desirable for men than women who gave birth to children the man had to provide for.  

对于那些耕种者来说，妻子不再那么有用了。他们仍然需要一个妻子来养活几个孩子。但是，由于他们必须用自己的劳动来养活所有的孩子，因此他们对无限多的孩子没有兴趣。因此，大多数男人都不再讨价还价，希望多娶几个妻子。对男人来说，生孩子并自己养活孩子的女人比生孩子要男人养活的女人更受欢迎。

When men needed to provide for their children with their own labor, their tastes changed. From the quantity of women, to the quality of one woman. Actually, such scarce conditions made the interests of the sexes converge like never before. Men are physically capable of having many more children than any woman. But in a Malthusian society where land is scarce, they mostly need to forego such opportunities if they want any surviving children and grandchildren. Under Malthusian conditions, humans get heavily [K-selected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory). The men who adapt to such conditions get selected for.   

当男人需要用自己的劳动养活孩子时，他们的口味就变了。从女人的数量，到一个女人的质量。事实上，这种稀缺的条件使得两性的利益前所未有地趋于一致。从生理上讲，男人可以比女人生更多的孩子。但在土地稀缺的马尔萨斯社会中，如果他们想要子孙满堂，大多需要放弃这样的机会。在马尔萨斯条件下，人类会受到严重的 K-选择。能够适应这种条件的男人会被选中。

All-in-all, this makes men and women more similar in their lifestyle and partner preferences. To the degree that women have been allowed to choose their partners, they have always stressed quality rather than quantity. Under crowded conditions where few people can realistically hope for more than a handful of children, men start doing the same. And in an economy where resources to feed one's children is the most crucial asset, a "high-quality woman" means a woman with resources. Enter the dowry economy.  

总而言之，这使得男性和女性在生活方式和伴侣偏好方面更加相似。在允许女性选择伴侣的范围内，她们总是强调质量而非数量。在拥挤的条件下，很少有人能切实地希望多生几个孩子，因此男性也开始这样做。而在经济中，养育子女的资源是最重要的资产，因此 "优质女性 "意味着拥有资源的女性。嫁妆经济应运而生。

In a population-dense society with rather low mortality levels, men know they will only be able to sustain a number of children. They will be able to provide an even smaller number of children with an inheritance, securing food for their grandchildren.  

在一个人口密集、死亡率相当低的社会里，男人们知道他们只能养活几个孩子。他们只能为数量更少的子女提供遗产，确保子孙后代有饭吃。

Marriageable women and their parents will look for one thing: A man who owns land. That gives men who own some land the power to choose. They will use that leverage to choose a woman who brings more land into the deal. Because essentially, both sexes are in the same situation: Land ownership is the great obstacle to their opportunity to have children and grandchildren.  

适婚女性和她们的父母会寻找一样东西：一个拥有土地的男人。这就给了拥有一些土地的男人选择的权力。他们会利用这个优势，选择一个能带来更多土地的女人。因为从本质上讲，男女双方的处境是一样的：土地所有权是他们生儿育女的最大障碍。

In population-dense societies, men and their parents learn that a woman in herself doesn't lead to optimal reproductive success. Only a woman bundled with resources does. So they narrow down their choice of a wife to a suitably propertied class of women. Women of that class do their best to distinguish themselves from less propertied women through visibly wearing some of their property. The exhibition of resources in the form of jewelry and elaborate dress becomes a means for young women and their parents to show that their daughters are in the pool of resource-endowed women whose children are likely to have a future in a crowded society.  

在人口密集的社会中，男人和他们的父母都知道，女人本身并不能带来最佳的生殖成功。只有与资源捆绑在一起的女人才会。因此，他们将妻子的选择范围缩小到有适当地位的女性阶层。这个阶层的女性会通过明显佩戴自己的一些财产，尽力将自己与地位较低的女性区分开来。以首饰和精致服饰的形式展示资源，成为年轻女性及其父母的一种手段，以表明他们的女儿属于资源丰富的女性群体，其子女很可能在拥挤的社会中拥有未来。

The above was what happened in Europe. At first, population was sparse and land was plentiful. In the northern parts of Europe, it remained so until a millennium ago or so. When larger military units were formed, peace and population increase ensued. More labor-intensive, less land-demanding agricultural practices took over. Peace decreased kidnapping risks, which made raising daughters less costly. The Christian church banned infantice and was more capable of actually enforcing the ban. By the 1000s, women of reproductive age had both become cheaper to raise and less in demand. In order to compete for grooms, parents started to sugar-coat their daughters with resources.  

上述情况就发生在欧洲。起初，欧洲人口稀少，土地肥沃。在欧洲北部地区，这种情况一直持续到一千多年前。当更大的军事单位形成后，和平与人口增长随之而来。劳动密集型、对土地要求较低的农业生产方式取代了传统的农业生产方式。和平降低了绑架的风险，从而降低了抚养女儿的成本。基督教会禁止堕胎，并且更有能力切实执行这一禁令。到了公元前 1000 年，育龄妇女的抚养成本降低了，需求也减少了。为了争夺新郎，父母们开始用资源为女儿 "糖衣炮弹"。

In East Asia, most of the above happened too. Larger political units were created. Which led to peace, which led to a Malthusian situation. And still, dowry payments did not become an important part of the culture in much of East Asia. Men actually continued paying for brides.   

在东亚，上述大部分情况也都发生了。更大的政治单位应运而生。这导致了和平，也导致了马尔萨斯式的局面。尽管如此，嫁妆并没有成为东亚大部分地区文化的重要组成部分。实际上，男子仍然继续花钱娶新娘。

In East Asia just like in Europe, more peaceful and crowded conditions made women plummet in value. As always, the demand for women followed the demand for children. When fewer children were in demand due to lack of food and future prospects, fewer women were in demand as well. But the Asians took another measure than the Europeans: Infanticide. Instead of stimulating the demand for women through bundling them with resources, Asian families simply cut the supply. The families of sons then paid the families of daughters some compensation for not having killed their daughter.  

在东亚，就像在欧洲一样，更加和平和拥挤的环境使妇女的价值急剧下降。一如既往，对妇女的需求紧随对儿童的需求。当由于缺乏食物和未来前景而对儿童的需求减少时，对妇女的需求也随之减少。但亚洲人比欧洲人采取了另一种措施：杀婴。亚洲家庭不是通过资源捆绑来刺激对妇女的需求，而是直接减少供应。儿子的家庭向女儿的家庭支付一定的补偿，因为他们没有杀死自己的女儿。

For that reason, I wouldn't say that dowry payments is a law that comes with the Malthusian condition. Rather, they come when living conditions get crowded and the supply of women cannot be restricted in a socially acceptable way.   

因此，我不会说嫁妆费是马尔萨斯条件下的一种法律。相反，当生活条件变得拥挤，无法以社会可接受的方式限制妇女的供应时，嫁妆费就会出现。

As many people have observed, Africa is the big brideprice economy of modern times. As Ester Boserup observed, since African agriculture centered around female labor, brideprice was the rule.  

正如许多人所观察到的那样，非洲是现代最大的过桥费经济体。正如埃斯特-博瑟鲁普（Ester Boserup）所言，由于非洲的农业以女性劳动力为中心，因此过桥费是一种普遍现象。

There is no reason to question that: Africa really is known for its female-led, non-plow agriculture. Geographical reasons have been cited, like soil quality and suitable crops: Maize is rather easy to hoe cultivate, and it suits the climate in much of Africa. But soil geography can't be the whole truth. It is not like European colonists gave their wives hoes and digging sticks when they arrived in South Africa because the soil was so suitable for female labor. Once upon a time, all agriculture was hoe agriculture, also in northern Europe. Ultimately, it is population density that makes societies take the step from less labor-intense female-led agriculture to more labor-intense male-led agriculture.  

没有理由质疑这一点：非洲确实以女性主导的非耕地农业而闻名。有人提出了一些地理原因，比如土壤质量和适合种植的作物：玉米很容易锄耕，而且适合非洲大部分地区的气候。但是，土壤地理不可能是事实的全部。欧洲殖民者并不是因为南非的土壤非常适合女性劳动，才在到达南非后给他们的妻子分发锄头和挖土棒的。曾经，所有的农业都是锄头农业，北欧也是如此。归根结底，是人口密度使社会从劳动强度较低的女性主导型农业迈向了劳动强度较高的男性主导型农业。

Before the 20th century, Africa never became densely populated. Wars, but above all nasty diseases kept population numbers down. Mortality remained high, so the population pressure that forced men into plow agriculture never arrived.   

20 世纪以前，非洲从未变得人口稠密。战争，尤其是可怕的疾病，使人口数量不断下降。死亡率居高不下，因此迫使人们从事犁耕农业的人口压力从未到来。

One peculiar fact underlines the specific nature of Africa in population matters: African men father more daughters than European, Asian and Native American men. When the father is of African origin, sex ratios tend to lie around 103 boys for 100 girls, compared to 106-107 for other ethnicities.

  

一个特殊的事实凸显了非洲在人口问题上的特殊性：非洲男性比欧洲、亚洲和美洲原住民男性生出更多的女儿。当父亲是非洲人时，性别比例往往是 103 个男孩对 100 个女孩，而其他种族则是 106-107 个。3 

This could be a direct effect of genetic drift: The few hundred people who went out of Africa and became the ancestors of all non-Africans might have had a higher tendency to father boys. But given the advantage of more than fifty percent male offspring in many human societies, it wouldn't be entirely strange if a tendency to father more sons than daughters was selected for. The reason why such tendencies weren't as much selected for in Africa might have been malaria. Since malaria in itself was such a killer, the need for killer males decreased compared to the need for breeding females. Groups that could keep their numbers up in the face of disease pressure might have had more of an advantage compared to in the rest of the world, where nature allowed more people to grow up and kill each other.  

这可能是基因漂移的直接影响：走出非洲并成为所有非非洲人祖先的几百人可能更倾向于生养男孩。但是，考虑到在许多人类社会中，男性后代所占比例超过 50%的优势，如果选择生男孩多于生女儿的倾向也并不完全奇怪。在非洲，这种倾向没有被选择的原因可能是疟疾。因为疟疾本身就是一个杀手，所以与对繁殖女性的需求相比，对男性杀手的需求减少了。与世界其他地方相比，那些在疾病压力下仍能保持一定数量的群体可能更有优势，因为在其他地方，大自然允许更多的人长大成人并自相残杀。

During the 20th century, when modern medicine reduced the mortality in Africa, population numbers soared. Birth rates have decreased, but not nearly to the levels of countries of similar wealth in the rest of the world (for example, Nigeria has two and a half times the fertility rate of comparably affluent India). There might still be a mentality from the continent's empty history, reflected in the still widely practiced custom of brideprice: There are even [reports](https://nation.africa/kenya/blogs-opinion/opinion/the-bride-price-app-that-got-people-talking-1143248) of apps that help people calculate the right price for their daughter.   

20 世纪，现代医学降低了非洲的死亡率，人口数量激增。出生率有所下降，但还远未达到世界其他富裕国家的水平（例如，尼日利亚的生育率是富裕国家印度的两倍半）。非洲大陆空洞的历史可能仍然存在一种思维定势，这反映在仍然广泛流行的聘礼习俗上：甚至有报道称，有应用程序可以帮助人们为女儿计算合适的价格。

Reports from India probably are what first taught most of us the word "_dowry_". The persistence of the custom of wealth transfers from the families of wives to the families of grooms gives the impression that the custom is very old. Surprisingly, it doesn't seem to be. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry_system_in_India) cites several ancient sources claiming that dowries were not paid in India.

Sarah Hrdy reports that in the lower castes, brideprice is still the norm: Low status men need to pay to get married.

  

印度的报道可能是我们大多数人第一次知道 "嫁妆 "这个词。妻子的家庭向新郎的家庭转移财富的习俗持续存在，给人的印象是这种习俗非常古老。令人惊讶的是，似乎并非如此。维基百科引用了一些古代资料，称印度人不支付嫁妆。4 莎拉-赫迪（Sarah Hrdy）报告说，在低种姓中，聘礼仍然是一种习俗：地位低下的男子需要花钱才能结婚。5

One important difference between India and Europe was the strong and formalized tradition of hypergamy in India. In Europe, two young persons of roughly equal class were usually brought together, each of them endowed with inherited wealth. In India, people were supposed to endow their daughters to buy them a place on a higher social level. In the 19th century in some Northern Indian high castes, all daughters were killed at birth, because where would they go?

  

印度与欧洲的一个重要区别是，印度有强大而正规化的一夫多妻制传统。在欧洲，两个阶级大致相同的年轻人通常会结合在一起，每个人都拥有继承的财富。而在印度，人们会把自己的女儿嫁出去，以换取更高的社会地位。19 世纪，在印度北部的一些高种姓中，所有女儿一出生就会被杀掉，因为她们会去哪里呢？6

From India there actually seems to be some evidence of a groom-price custom. In most places, the dowry clearly went to the household of the daughter to the benefit of her children. However, in northern India Stanley S Tambiah found blurred lines between the dowry and the rest of the finances of the husband's extended family.

  

在印度，似乎确实有一些证据表明存在新郎价格习俗。在大多数地方，嫁妆显然归女儿的家庭所有，并使其子女受益。然而，在印度北部，斯坦利-S-坦比亚发现嫁妆和丈夫大家庭的其他经济来源之间的界限很模糊。7

When land was replaced by human capital as the most important asset, most societies abandoned explicit dowry payments. But not in India. Instead, the tradition of buying a place in a higher social class continued. Many parents of sons find it fair that they should get some of the money they invested in their son's education back. If they take in a woman into the social class where they have paid to be, shouldn't her family pay for an entry ticket too?

  

当人力资本取代土地成为最重要的资产时，大多数社会都放弃了明确的嫁妆支付。但印度没有。相反，在较高的社会阶层购买一席之地的传统仍在继续。许多儿子的父母认为，他们应该拿回一部分投资在儿子教育上的钱，这样才公平。如果他们收留一个女人，让她进入他们花钱买到的社会阶层，难道她的家人不应该也支付一张入场券吗？8

They say that in the Western world, brideprice and dowry are lost traditions. Brideprice definitely is: Parents of young women are not paid when their daughters get married.  

有人说，在西方世界，聘礼和嫁妆已成为失传的传统。聘礼肯定是：女儿出嫁时，年轻女性的父母是不需要付钱的。

But I'm not so sure the dowry tradition has been lost. Actually, parents still invest quite a lot in the social standing of their children. But they invest in other things than in pre-modern times. Instead of transferable assets like land, they help their children build up their individual human capital.  

但我不确定嫁妆传统是否已经失传。事实上，父母仍然会为子女的社会地位投入很多。但与前现代相比，他们投资的是其他东西。他们不投资土地等可转让资产，而是帮助子女积累个人的人力资本。

The pre-modern dowry system was adapted to an environment where women moved away from their kin while men stayed at the family property. Today, both men and women are supposed to move away from their parents and create entirely new households. In that sense, both boys and girls are in the same situation as girls were a few hundred years ago.  

前现代的嫁妆制度是为了适应妇女搬离亲属而男子留在家庭财产中的环境。如今，男人和女人都应该离开父母，建立全新的家庭。从这个意义上说，男孩和女孩的处境与几百年前的女孩相同。

Parents are still doing their best to support their children, both directly and indirectly. Direct help in the form of financial aid to buy a house or other capital goods is not unheard of although still somewhat frowned upon. But indirect help in the form of the best education the parents can buy and the best upbringing they can provide is more or less seen as the norm. Parents might not even be aware of it themselves but what they are doing is helping their children secure the best possible spot on the marriage market . Just like during the times when dowries were paid out at the occasion of a marriage, people know that the best way to form a family with high social status is to combine a high-status man and a high-status woman. Two high salaries simply buy a nicer inner-city apartment than only one high salary.  

父母仍在尽最大努力直接或间接地支持子女。直接帮助子女买房或购买其他资本货物，这种形式的经济援助并非闻所未闻，尽管仍然有些不受欢迎。但以父母所能购买的最好的教育和最好的抚养方式提供的间接帮助，或多或少已被视为常态。父母可能自己都没有意识到，但他们正在帮助自己的子女在婚姻市场上获得尽可能好的位置。就像在结婚时要支付嫁妆的时代一样，人们知道，组建一个具有较高社会地位的家庭的最佳方式是将高地位的男性和高地位的女性结合起来。两份高薪比一份高薪更容易买到一套更好的市内公寓。

For that reason I wouldn't say that the dowry tradition is dead. It has rather been extended to both sexes. Now, just like before, young people who have not received help from parents or kin to rise socially have a much harder time rising to new social heights and finding a mate on that higher social level.  

因此，我不会说嫁妆传统已经消亡。相反，它已扩展到男女两性。现在，就像以前一样，没有得到父母或亲戚帮助的年轻人要想在社会上崭露头角，要想在更高的社会层次上找到伴侣，就难上加难了。

The main difference compared to the agricultural society of yesterday is that far from all people in the marriage market are there with the aim of breeding. In crowded societies there is always a market for sex-without-breeding, usually in the form of prostitution. Through prostitution, men got an outlet for their no longer success-bringing instinct to have sex with as many and as fertile women as possible. As such, prostitution harks back to an even more ancient time when men earned gene-spreading opportunities through appreciating all fertile women, regardless of social status.  

与过去的农业社会相比，主要的不同之处在于，婚姻市场上的人远非都以繁衍后代为目的。在拥挤的社会中，总有一个不以繁衍后代为目的的性市场，通常以卖淫的形式存在。通过卖淫，男人们获得了一个发泄的渠道，他们不再有成功的本能，而是尽可能多地与有生育能力的女人发生性关系。因此，卖淫可以追溯到更久远的年代，那时的男人通过欣赏所有有生育能力的女人来赢得传播基因的机会，而不管她们的社会地位如何。

As social norms regarding sexuality and reproduction were loosened, the two systems got blurred. We still have a very obvious dowry economy, where richly endowed men and women form even more endowed couples. But we also have a market of lust, where the focus lies on lust for naked beauty, like it did in ancient, uncrowded societies. The first, dowry-based, system is supposed to result in children. The latter, lust-based, system is not. Nonetheless, people in the two systems mingle freely on a common relationship market.  

随着有关性和生殖的社会规范的松动，这两种制度变得模糊不清。我们仍然有非常明显的嫁妆经济，在这种经济中，富有的男人和女人组成了更富有的夫妻。但我们也有一个情欲市场，在这个市场中，人们对赤裸裸的美貌的欲望成为焦点，就像在古代不拥挤的社会中一样。前者以嫁妆为基础，其目的是为了生儿育女。而后一种以欲望为基础的制度则不然。尽管如此，这两种制度下的人们在一个共同的关系市场上自由交融。

This makes life difficult especially for those in the dowry section of the relationship market. The lust-focused section does not mind very much if they catch a lust-based or a dowry-based individual from the market pool. But a dowry-focused participant does not want to waste time on someone only in it for the lust.   

这就给感情市场上的嫁妆市场带来了困难。注重欲望的人并不太介意他们从市场上抓到一个以欲望为基础或以嫁妆为基础的人。但以嫁妆为重点的参与者不想在只为情欲的人身上浪费时间。

Yesterday, amassing a fortune big enough to marry was the main  difficulty for men and women who wanted to form families. Today, amassing the earning power is only the first step. The second step is to avoid squandering it on people who do not even intend to form families. On that point, we might be experiencing cultural evolution in real time: Families and communities whose young people are able to avoid such pitfalls are at an advantage compared to families and communities where the kids spend their time and resources dating their way into reproductive dead-ends.  

昨天，积累足够多的财富以便结婚是希望组建家庭的男女所面临的主要困难。如今，积累财富只是第一步。第二步是避免将财富挥霍在根本不打算组建家庭的人身上。在这一点上，我们可能正在经历实时的文化演变：与那些孩子们把时间和资源花在约会上，陷入生育死胡同的家庭和社区相比，年轻人能够避免这些陷阱的家庭和社区更具优势。

The cultural evolution of uncrowded, high mortality societies favored families that amassed resources and used them to pay the brideprice for women. The cultural evolution of crowded agricultural societies favored families that amassed resources and used dowry payments to combine them. Today's cultural evolution favors families that both endow their children and help those children use their endowment to maximal reproductive effect.  

人烟稀少、死亡率高的社会的文化演变有利于那些积累资源并用这些资源为妇女支付聘礼的家庭。拥挤的农业社会的文化进化有利于积累资源并用嫁妆来组合资源的家庭。今天的文化进化则有利于那些既能赋予子女财富，又能帮助子女利用其财富实现最大生殖效应的家庭。
