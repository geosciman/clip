Yaizu, Shizuoka Pref. –  

静冈县清水市-

Moves are spreading in Japan to set up private libraries where each bookshelf is owned by individuals who display books on their hobbies or those that they recommend.  

在日本，建立私人图书馆的行动正在蔓延，每个书架都归个人所有，他们展示自己爱好的书籍或自己推荐的书籍。

Such libraries are helping revitalize local communities by creating a place where people can mingle through events. Around 50 such facilities have been created throughout the country.  

这些图书馆通过举办活动，为人们提供了一个交流的场所，有助于振兴当地社区。全国各地已经建立了大约 50 个这样的设施。

The first such library was opened in March 2020 in a deserted shopping street in Yaizu, Shizuoka Prefecture, by Junya Dohi, who is originally from the city, using an empty store space.  

2020 年 3 月，来自静冈县烧津市的土肥纯也利用一个空置的商店空间，在一条荒废的商业街上开设了第一家这样的图书馆。

The Minna no Toshokan Sankaku library is currently home to around 3,000 books, with the majority brought in by bookshelf owners who have paid ¥2,000 a month to rent a bookshelf.  

Minna no Toshokan Sankaku 图书馆目前藏有约 3,000 本图书，其中大部分是由每月支付 2,000 日元租用书架的书架拥有者带来的。

Such books come with a piece of paper for readers to write down their thoughts on the books. One bookshelf owner said, "I'm delighted to read feedback on books picked to reflect my view on the world."  

这类书籍附有一张纸，供读者写下对书籍的感想。一位书架的主人说："我很高兴能读到读者对所选书的反馈，这些书反映了我对世界的看法"。

Bookshelf owners are also involved in library operations, including being at the library to assist visitors. The setup does not involve any personnel costs, Dohi, 28, said, adding that rent and utility costs are all covered by bookshelf rental fees and other sources of income.  

书架的所有者也参与图书馆的运营，包括在图书馆为来访者提供帮助。28 岁的 Dohi 说，这种设置不涉及任何人员费用，并补充说，租金和水电费全部由书架租赁费和其他收入来源支付。

Some people were initially skeptical that people would pay money to rent a bookshelf. The idea, however, proved to be a hit, with some people placed on waiting lists to rent a bookshelf at one point.  

有些人起初对人们花钱租书架持怀疑态度。但事实证明，这个想法大受欢迎，一些人一度被列入租用书架的候选名单。

The Yaizu library, which now welcomes around 300 to 400 users per month, has become a place for interaction, bringing people back to the shopping street once again.  

现在，烧津图书馆每月接待约 300 到 400 名用户，已成为一个互动场所，让人们再次回到商业街。

Many local government officials outside of Yaizu who are interested in community revitalization have paid a visit to the library. Among them is Koichi Kashiwagi, 39, who works for the city government in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture.  

许多对社区振兴感兴趣的烧津以外的地方政府官员都曾访问过图书馆。其中包括 39 岁的柏木幸一（Koichi Kashiwagi），他在兵库县尼崎市政府工作。

Using the city's program granting side businesses for regional revitalization, Kashiwagi opened a similar library in a vacant store space in an Amagasaki shopping street in January this year.  

今年 1 月，柏木利用该市的地区振兴副业资助计划，在尼崎商业街的一个空置店面里开设了一家类似的图书馆。

Around 80% of bookshelves at the Santosho library are occupied. Some elementary school children visit the library to study.  

三多乡图书馆约有 80% 的书架被占用。一些小学生到图书馆学习。

"People are starting to stop by at the shopping street on their way home after enjoying their time here," Kashiwagi said of the Santosho library.  

"Kashiwagi 谈到 Santosho 图书馆时说："人们开始在享受完这里的时光后，在回家的路上顺便去购物街看看。

Dohi said that he launched the Yaizu library as a social experiment. Such libraries "can be set up anywhere with just bookshelves" if people want interactions, he said.  

土肥说，他创办烧津图书馆是一次社会实验。他说，只要人们愿意互动，"在任何地方都可以建立这样的图书馆，只要有书架"。
