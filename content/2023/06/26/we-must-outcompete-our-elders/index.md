That [previous post](https://everythingisbullshit.substack.com/p/theres-a-problem-with-our-desires) was a real bummer—sorry. In that post, I argued that most of our desires are competitive, and that, therefore, our desires cannot all be satisfied. Most of our strivings are collectively futile, and we’re going nowhere as a species, except toward [increasingly convoluted status games](https://psyarxiv.com/avh9t/).  

上一篇文章真是让人扫兴--对不起。在那篇文章中，我认为我们的大多数欲望都是竞争性的，因此，我们的欲望不可能都得到满足。我们的大多数努力都是徒劳的，作为一个物种，除了走向越来越复杂的地位游戏外，我们没有任何进展。

Can we do anything about this? Is there a way out of our collective [death spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_mill) of endless status jockeying? To my astonishment, no scholar has confronted this question head-on (at least that I’m aware of). It’s time we all started pondering it.   

我们能对此做什么吗？是否有办法摆脱我们无休止的地位争夺的集体死亡漩涡？令我吃惊的是，没有一个学者正面面对这个问题（至少我知道）。现在是我们都开始思考这个问题的时候了。

What we’re looking for is a _loophole_—some way we can satisfy everybody’s competitive desires at the same time, by making everybody better off than somebody else, but in a way that the “somebody else” is okay with. Is that possible?  

我们正在寻找的是一个漏洞--我们可以通过某种方式同时满足每个人的竞争欲望，让每个人都比别人过得好，但要让 "别人 "接受。这有可能吗？

Maybe. One way we can do this is by giving each generation more of what it wants than the previous generation. When status and living standards rise from generation to generation, there’s nobody at the bottom. Everybody’s better off than somebody, and that somebody is always the previous generation. But here’s the loophole: the previous generation is _okay_ with this, because they _want_ future generations, which include their children and grandchildren, to be better off than themselves—[they’re nepotistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kin_selection). Stable, long-run economic growth somehow squares the circle and lets everybody win a zero-sum game. To solve the tragedy of the human condition—to satisfy everyone’s icky desires and reduce our competitive bullshit—we must continually outcompete our elders. It’s the solution to all our problems.  

也许吧。我们可以做到这一点的一个方法是，给每一代人比上一代人更多他们想要的东西。当地位和生活水平代代相传时，没有人处于底层。每个人都比别人过得好，而这个人总是上一代人。但这里有一个漏洞：上一代人对此无所谓，因为他们希望未来的几代人，包括他们的孩子和孙子，都比自己过得好--他们是裙带关系。稳定的、长期的经济增长在某种程度上填补了这个圈子，让每个人都能在零和游戏中获胜。为了解决人类的悲剧--满足每个人的恶心欲望，减少我们的竞争性废话--我们必须不断地超越我们的长辈。这是解决我们所有问题的办法。

Let’s call this theory, “Intergenerational Competition Theory”, or, for those of you who like acronyms, “ICT”.  

让我们把这个理论称为 "代际竞争理论"，或者，对于那些喜欢缩写的人来说，称为 "ICT"。

ICT resolves a lot of puzzling findings in the literature on life satisfaction and economic development. It explains why [historically wealthier countries have higher life satisfaction than poorer countries](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aaron-Ahuvia/publication/234777751_Wealth_Consumption_and_Happiness/links/02e7e5290c8d04e320000000/Wealth-Consumption-and-Happiness.pdf), even though [rapid increases in national wealth do](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/) _[not](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/)_ [make citizens more satisfied with their lives](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/03/23/the-price-of-glee-in-china/). That is, if everyone gets rich all of a sudden at the same time, then nobody is satisfied, because everybody still has the same wealth and status as their rivals. But if the economy grows gradually over multiple generations, with each generation getting richer and higher status than the previous generation, _then_ people get satisfied, and society [becomes more peaceful and stable](https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Consequences-Economic-Growth/dp/1400095719).<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437">[1]</sup> Declining respect for elders, it seems, goes hand in hand with declining violence, corruption, and societal decay.  

信息技术解决了关于生活满意度和经济发展的文献中很多令人困惑的发现。它解释了为什么历史上较富裕的国家比较贫穷的国家有更高的生活满意度，尽管国家财富的快速增长并没有使公民对他们的生活更加满意。也就是说，如果每个人都在同一时间突然变得富有，那么没有人感到满意，因为每个人的财富和地位仍然与他们的对手相同。但如果经济在多代人中逐渐增长，每一代人都比上一代人更富有，地位更高，那么人们就会得到满足，社会也会变得更加和平和稳定。 <sup data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437" data-immersive-translate-effect="1">[1]</sup> 对长辈的尊重程度下降，似乎与暴力、腐败和社会衰败的下降相伴而行。

ICT might also explain why working-class white people, around a decade ago, suffered a huge increase in “[deaths of despair](https://www.amazon.com/Deaths-Despair-Future-Capitalism-Anne/dp/069119078X)” and later embraced a “[burn it all down](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2020.0147)” Trumpian populism. It’s not that they were poor or disadvantaged _per se_. Nonwhite people were (and still are) significantly poorer and more disadvantaged, yet they weren’t dying of despair. Why the difference? Nonwhite people thought they were [better off than their parents’ generation](https://news.gallup.com/poll/160166/youth-say-better-off-parents.aspx), likely because prior generations were more overtly discriminatory. Working class white people, on the other hand, [thought they were](https://imdiversity.com/diversity-news/optimism-of-whites-in-us-lags-blacks-by-big-margin/) _[worse](https://imdiversity.com/diversity-news/optimism-of-whites-in-us-lags-blacks-by-big-margin/)_ [off than their parents’ generation](https://imdiversity.com/diversity-news/optimism-of-whites-in-us-lags-blacks-by-big-margin/), likely due to rising urbanization, educational credentialism, and declining low-skilled manufacturing work. Some working-class white people even thought [they were worse off than African Americans](http://lencrenoir.com/pdf/raceinternortonsommers2011.pdf), due to the zero-sum nature of social status: as one group rises, another must fall. The result was a white populist backlash that nearly destroyed American democracy (and still might).<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437">[2]</sup>  

信息技术也可以解释为什么工人阶级的白人，大约在十年前，遭受了 "绝望的死亡 "的巨大增长，后来拥抱了 "烧掉一切 "的特朗普民粹主义。这并不是说他们贫穷或处于不利地位本身。非白人过去（现在也是）明显更穷，处境更不利，但他们并没有死于绝望。为什么会有这种差别？非白人认为他们比他们的父母那一代人生活得更好，可能是因为前几代人更加公开地歧视。另一方面，工薪阶层的白人认为他们比他们父母那一代人的生活更糟糕，这可能是因为城市化的发展、教育证书制度和低技能的制造业工作的减少。一些工薪阶层的白人甚至认为他们比非裔美国人更差，这是因为社会地位的零和性质：一个群体上升，另一个群体就必须下降。其结果是白人民粹主义的反弹，几乎摧毁了美国的民主（现在仍然可能）。 <sup data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437" data-immersive-translate-effect="1">[2]</sup>

There is an important lesson here. In order to collectively satisfy our icky, competitive desires, we must ensure that everybody outcompetes their parents and grandparents in the game of life. Old people must never be cool. This ongoing upstaging of the elderly is crucial to the long-term wellbeing of our species, and it must continue for _all_ demographic groups—or else we’re fucked. The moment any segment of society stops outcompeting their elders is the moment society starts to unravel. We must keep trouncing our elders, generation after generation, or else the fundamental tragedy of the human condition will catch up to us, and we will literally die of sadness.  

这里有一个重要的教训。为了集体满足我们恶心的竞争欲望，我们必须确保每个人都在生活游戏中胜过他们的父母和祖父母。老人必须永远不酷。这种对老年人的持续打击对我们这个物种的长期福祉至关重要，而且它必须在所有人口群体中继续下去，否则我们就完蛋了。当社会的任何部分停止超越他们的长辈的时候，就是社会开始解体的时候。我们必须一代又一代地击败我们的长辈，否则人类条件的基本悲剧就会追上我们，而我们将真正地死于悲伤。

<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437">[1]</sup> If ICT is right, then the contemporary correlation between national wealth and national life satisfaction will be moderated by the duration and consistency of prior economic growth, and mediated by perceptions of intergenerational improvement, optimism for the future, and/or (dis)respect for elders.  

<sup data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437" data-immersive-translate-effect="1">[1]</sup> 如果ICT是正确的，那么国民财富和国民生活满意度之间的当代相关性将被之前经济增长的持续时间和一致性所缓和，并由代际改善、对未来的乐观态度和/或对长辈的（不）尊重的看法所调解。

<sup data-immersive-translate-effect="1" data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437">[2]</sup> There’s a complication. Shortly after I wrote this post, I discovered that [black men recently overtook white men in “deaths of despair” (i.e. drug overdose deaths)](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/19/recent-surge-in-u-s-drug-overdose-deaths-has-hit-black-men-the-hardest/#:~:text=The%20fatality%20rate%20for%20overdoses,7.5%20deaths%20per%20100%2C000%20people.), casting doubt on my specific thesis here. Then again, maybe black men recently stopped believing themselves to be better off than their elders (maybe because of police shootings?), which might account for the recent increase in deaths of despair among that group (to my knowledge, no one has looked into this hypothesis). If it turned out that these deaths have nothing to do with the failure to outcompete one’s elders (or one’s children and grandchildren’s failure to outcompete oneself), then my theory would take a hit, but it wouldn’t be falsified. The theory might still be true—it might just not explain deaths of despair. It might be that those deaths are due to other causes.  

<sup data-immersive_translate_walked="eedcac6f-95b8-4f53-aff8-d4c406f50437" data-immersive-translate-effect="1">[2]</sup> 这里有一个复杂的问题。在我写完这篇文章后不久，我发现黑人男子最近在 "绝望的死亡"（即吸毒过量的死亡）方面超过了白人男子，这使我的具体论点受到怀疑。然后，也许黑人男子最近不再相信自己比他们的长辈过得好（也许是因为警察的枪击事件），这可能是该群体最近绝望死亡人数增加的原因（据我所知，没有人研究过这个假设）。如果事实证明这些死亡与未能胜过自己的长辈（或自己的子孙未能胜过自己）无关，那么我的理论将受到打击，但它不会被证伪。这个理论可能仍然是真实的--它可能只是不能解释绝望的死亡。可能这些死亡是由其他原因造成的。
