In order to get where you’re going, you need to know where you came from.  
为了到达你要去的地方，你需要知道你来自哪里。

When it comes to learning, you need a way to **measure your progress toward your goal**. How will you know whether you learned it? How will you compare your performance before and after? What concretely will you be able to do at the other end that you can’t do now?  
在学习方面，您需要一种方法来衡量您实现目标的进度。你怎么知道你是否学会了？您将如何比较前后的表现？你在另一端具体可以做什么而你现在不能做？

This is why a reliable _**evaluation**_ is a critical tool for any student.  
这就是为什么可靠的评估对任何学生来说都是一个重要的工具。

In sports you might do a jump test, or run the mile, or swim as many laps as you can. To receive a driver’s license, you need to take a written test and a driving test. In any domain where it’s important to measure progress, we need tests.  
在运动中，您可能会进行跳跃测试、跑一英里或尽可能多地游几圈。要获得驾驶执照，您需要参加笔试和驾驶考试。在衡量进展很重要的任何领域，我们都需要测试。

But when it comes to our personal productivity, measurement has always been incredibly challenging. Knowledge work especially is extremely inconsistent from person to person, or even from one project to another. **Every measure of quality in work output is so subjective**, that the only meaningful evaluations tend to be performance reviews based on the opinions of the people we work with.  
但是当涉及到我们的个人生产力时，衡量一直是非常具有挑战性的。尤其是知识工作，在人与人之间，甚至在一个项目与另一个项目之间，都是极其不一致的。工作产出中的每一项质量衡量标准都非常主观，以至于唯一有意义的评估往往是基于与我们一起工作的人的意见的绩效评估。

A couple years ago I set out to create an evaluation that would help me understand how my students learn. I teach a course on **Personal Knowledge Management (PKM)** – how to save, organize, and apply one’s knowledge to solve problems and deliver creative work. It’s called Building a Second Brain, and since January 2017 over 5,000 people have taken it. I’ve drawn on that experience to create a new evaluation called **The 4 Levels of Personal Knowledge Management**.  
几年前，我着手创建一个评估，以帮助我了解我的学生是如何学习的。我教授一门关于个人知识管理 (PKM) 的课程——如何保存、组织和应用一个人的知识来解决问题和交付创造性工作。它被称为“打造第二个大脑”，自 2017 年 1 月以来，已有超过 5,000 人服用了它。我利用那次经验创建了一个名为“个人知识管理的 4 个级别”的新评估。

It describes the most common path of improvement I see in my students. The definitions aren’t definitive, and individual results obviously vary greatly. But they capture the common experience of the majority of the students who learn my **4-stage process for knowledge management**, known as CODE:  
它描述了我在学生身上看到的最常见的改进途径。这些定义不是确定的，而且个别结果显然差异很大。但它们抓住了大多数学习我的知识管理 4 阶段流程（称为 CODE）的学生的共同经验：

-   **Capture**: Saving valuable information from the internet and the world around you  
    捕获：从互联网和您周围的世界中保存有价值的信息
-   **Organize**: Breaking that information into small chunks and preparing them for later use  
    组织：将信息分成小块并准备好以备后用
-   **Distill**: Extracting the pieces of knowledge most relevant to your current goals  
    提炼：提取与您当前目标最相关的知识片段
-   **Express**: Turning your knowledge into creative output that has an impact on others  
    表达：将您的知识转化为对他人有影响的创造性成果

This is a self-evaluation. All you have to do is **read the descriptions for each of the 4 levels** below, and the one that most closely matches your current experience is likely the level you’re at.  
这是自我评价。您所要做的就是阅读以下 4 个级别中每个级别的说明，最符合您当前体验的级别可能就是您所处的级别。

Level 1: Storing Information 级别 1：存储信息

You use software programs on your computer or apps on your mobile device to receive, edit, and send information (such as via email, calendars, or a web browser). You have a basic understanding of how these programs work and feel comfortable using them in your day to day life.  
您使用计算机上的软件程序或移动设备上的应用程序来接收、编辑和发送信息（例如通过电子邮件、日历或网络浏览器）。您对这些程序的工作原理有基本的了解，并且在日常生活中使用它们感觉很自在。

You organize your files using defaults suggested by the software itself. For example, a Documents folder with subfolders inside. You may not feel completely comfortable saving files because you’re not sure how or when you’ll see them again. But you feel reasonably confident that you can find your most important files when you need them.  
您可以使用软件本身建议的默认设置来组织文件。例如，一个包含子文件夹的 Documents 文件夹。您可能不太愿意保存文件，因为您不确定如何或何时再次看到它们。但是您相当有信心可以在需要时找到最重要的文件。

You take notes sparingly on your smartphone or mobile device, and mostly for one-time, practical tasks like keeping a grocery list, notes from a meeting or phone call, or saving bookmarks from websites. You may even occasionally save notes from sources you consume, such as books or podcasts, but don’t do much with them.  
您很少在智能手机或移动设备上做笔记，而且大多是一次性的、实际的任务，例如保存购物清单、会议或电话中的笔记，或者保存网站上的书签。你甚至可以偶尔从你消费的资源中保存笔记，比如书籍或播客，但不要对它们做太多。

## Level 2: Managing Knowledge 第 2 级：管理知识

You have begun to capture not just factual information, but ideas and creative inspiration: lessons you’ve learned, ideas you’ve had, quotes that resonated, connections between ideas, metaphors and analogies, observations and personal reflections, etc. This includes both ideas from your own thoughts and from external sources.  
你已经开始不仅捕捉事实信息，还捕捉想法和创意灵感：你学到的教训、你的想法、引起共鸣的引语、想法之间的联系、隐喻和类比、观察和个人反思等。这包括来自您自己的想法和来自外部资源的想法。

You have a strong command of how and where to save files, which gives you the confidence to invest real time and effort into writing down what you know. Digital note-taking in some form is a significant part of your daily life, and you enjoy capturing information from a wide variety of sources such as documents, books, articles, photos, drawings, screenshots, business cards, videos, or recipes. You are on your devices like everyone else, but you are not just consuming information. You are capturing the best of what you find in your own personal library of knowledge.  
您对保存文件的方式和位置有很强的掌握，这使您有信心投入实际时间和精力来写下您所知道的内容。某种形式的数字笔记是您日常生活的重要组成部分，您喜欢从文档、书籍、文章、照片、绘图、屏幕截图、名片、视频或食谱等各种来源捕捉信息。你和其他人一样在你的设备上，但你不仅仅是在消费信息。您正在捕捉您在自己的个人知识库中找到的最好的东西。

At this level your notes begin to work as a thought partner, reminding you of things you’d completely forgotten and surfacing unexpected connections between ideas. The emphasis shifts from capturing more information, to putting to use the knowledge you already have. You regularly refine your knowledge management tools and perform small experiments to discover better ways of doing things.  
在此级别，您的笔记开始充当思想伙伴，提醒您已经完全忘记的事情，并使想法之间出现意想不到的联系。重点从获取更多信息转移到使用您已有的知识。您定期改进您的知识管理工具并进行小实验以发现更好的做事方式。

At this level, maintaining your system frees up more time and energy than it takes to maintain. Your mind is more clear and able to focus because you know that everything important is reliably saved. You have a clear picture of how information flows through your system and ends up as tangible deliverables in the world.  
在此级别上，维护您的系统可以释放比维护更多的时间和精力。你的头脑更加清晰，能够集中注意力，因为你知道所有重要的事情都得到了可靠的保存。您清楚地了解信息如何流经您的系统并最终成为世界上有形的可交付成果。

## Level 3: Enabling Action 第 3 级：促成行动

You have started to shift your attention from the world of ideas to the world of action. You aren’t satisfied with generating insights, but want to see those insights manifested in the real world. You are committed to using your insights to tangibly improve your learning, health, career, business, and society.  
您已经开始将注意力从思想世界转移到行动世界。您不满足于产生洞察力，而是希望看到这些洞察力在现实世界中得到体现。您致力于利用您的见解切实改善您的学习、健康、职业、业务和社会。

You become more discerning and selective about the information you consume, strongly preferring only the highest quality, most substantive sources that directly relate to the goals you are working toward. You use your notes to take on more ambitious, more complex projects than you would be able to manage on your own. You are dramatically more productive, creative, and relaxed than you would be otherwise.  
您对所消费的信息变得更加敏锐和有选择性，强烈偏好仅与您正在努力实现的目标直接相关的最高质量、最实质性的来源。你用你的笔记来承担比你自己能够管理的更雄心勃勃、更复杂的项目。与其他情况相比，您的工作效率、创造力和放松程度显着提高。

At this level, you apply just as much creativity to the workings of your system as to the knowledge it contains. You often surprise yourself with new, creative ways of using your notes, or find that they push your thinking in new directions. You change the way you work to integrate your knowledge management system as deeply into your thinking as possible because of the incredible leverage it gives you.  
在这个级别上，您对系统的运作应用的创造力与其所包含的知识一样多。您经常会对自己使用笔记的新的、创造性的方式感到惊讶，或者发现它们将您的思维推向了新的方向。你改变了你的工作方式，将你的知识管理系统尽可能深入地融入你的思维，因为它给你带来了难以置信的影响力。

The benefits of your system extend beyond your personal goals and begin to impact the people around you. You make your most valuable knowledge available to others in concrete form, such as through a website, blog, social media feed, podcast, or product. Which means you are constantly attracting new opportunities and collaborations as others encounter your work. When working with others, you often surface solutions or promising leads to other people’s challenges within seconds or minutes. You are more trusting of others, because you’ve learned to give up control and trust something outside of yourself.  
您系统的好处超出了您的个人目标，并开始影响您周围的人。您以具体形式向他人提供您最有价值的知识，例如通过网站、博客、社交媒体提要、播客或产品。这意味着当其他人遇到您的工作时，您会不断吸引新的机会和合作。与他人合作时，您通常会在几秒钟或几分钟内提出解决方案或承诺解决其他人面临的挑战。你更信任别人，因为你学会了放弃控制并相信自己以外的事物。

Interacting with your note-taking system brings you a sense of excitement and inspiration. You have complete confidence that you can take in any kind of information, break it into small pieces, and prepare them for quick retrieval in future projects, both known and unknown. You understand both the strengths and weaknesses of your system, and know how to use the system to improve itself. You are humbled and reassured that you are not solely responsible for all the thinking and remembering that needs to happen in your life.  
与您的笔记系统互动会给您带来兴奋和灵感。您完全有信心可以接收任何类型的信息，将其分解成小块，并准备好它们以便在未来的项目中快速检索，无论是已知的还是未知的。您了解系统的优点和缺点，并且知道如何使用系统来改进自身。您感到谦卑并放心，您不应该独自对生活中需要发生的所有思考和记忆负责。

Your knowledge management system gives you the confidence that you have more than enough research and supporting material for anything you want to pursue. Which means you have the freedom to pursue the most exciting, inspiring, and important pursuits you can think of.  
你的知识管理系统让你相信你有足够的研究和支持材料来完成你想要追求的任何事情。这意味着您可以自由地追求您能想到的最激动人心、最鼓舞人心和最重要的追求。

## Level 4: Personal Knowledge Mastery  
第 4 级：个人知识掌握

The final level never ends – it is an infinite horizon of possibilities extending in whichever direction you want to go.  
最终关卡永无止境——它是一个无限可能的地平线，向你想去的任何方向延伸。

Your knowledge works as a system greater than the sum of its parts, pulling in new material almost of its own will and effortlessly sorting and distilling it to support your long-term projects and goals. There is a constant output from your Second Brain into the external world, taking the form of documents, essays, summaries, designs, videos, presentations, and more. You use these artifacts to make powerfully persuasive arguments, to recruit people to your cause, and to build an unassailable reputation for innovation and leadership. Your system continuously evolves and improves over time using the ideas it encounters, seemingly on its own.  
您的知识作为一个系统发挥作用，大于其各个部分的总和，几乎可以根据自己的意愿吸收新材料，并毫不费力地对其进行分类和提炼，以支持您的长期项目和目标。你的第二大脑不断向外部世界输出文件、论文、摘要、设计、视频、演示文稿等形式。您可以使用这些人工制品来提出强有力的有说服力的论据，为您的事业招募人才，并在创新和领导力方面建立无懈可击的声誉。随着时间的推移，你的系统会使用它遇到的想法不断发展和改进，似乎是独立的。

All your digital tools are integrated and work seamlessly together, requiring only occasional intervention on your part. They work together to reliably produce creative breakthroughs. You are able to focus completely on whatever attracts your attention because virtually all of your work-in-process is managed outside your head. You are practically immune to interruptions, and can make progress in any span of time and in any environment.  
您所有的数字工具都集成在一起，可以无缝地协同工作，您只需要偶尔进行干预。他们一起工作以可靠地产生创造性的突破。您可以完全专注于任何吸引您注意力的事情，因为几乎所有在制品都在您的头脑之外进行管理。您几乎不受干扰，并且可以在任何时间跨度和任何环境中取得进步。

You use your Second Brain not only to acquire knowledge, but entirely new skills and capabilities. You know that you are not only accumulating a priceless store of intellectual capital, but an encyclopedia of tacit and experiential knowledge that is unique to you. This tacit knowledge allows you to “punch above your intellectual weight,” reliably producing solutions that others can’t imitate.  
您不仅可以使用第二大脑来获取知识，还可以使用全新的技能和能力。您知道您不仅在积累无价的智力资本，而且还在积累您独有的默会知识和经验知识的百科全书。这种隐性知识可以让你“超越你的智力”，可靠地产生其他人无法模仿的解决方案。

Eventually you also master the flow of information happening inside you – your innermost thoughts, feelings, intuitions, and desires. You use your system to study your own inner workings like a scientist. Your notes track patterns in your thinking and learning over time, helping you understand your own evolution and direct it intentionally. You are occasionally overcome with a sense of awe at the beauty and elegance of the system you’ve created – what it’s capable of, what it knows, and how it all works together in ways that you didn’t think were possible.  
最终你也掌握了你内心发生的信息流——你内心深处的想法、感受、直觉和欲望。你像科学家一样使用你的系统来研究你自己的内部运作。随着时间的推移，您的笔记会跟踪您的思考和学习模式，帮助您了解自己的进化并有意识地引导它。您偶尔会对自己创建的系统的美丽和优雅产生敬畏之情——它的能力、知识以及它们如何以您认为不可能的方式协同工作。

Ideas course through your two minds like electricity, filling you with an expansive feeling of power and potential. It feels like you have a secret key that unlocks the underlying nature of reality – it’s all just information. You are in control of your experience, shaping and tweaking flows of information like rivers across the landscape of your life.  
想法像电流一样穿过你的两个头脑，让你充满力量和潜力。感觉就像你有一把秘密钥匙，可以解开现实的本质——一切都只是信息。您可以控制自己的体验，塑造和调整信息流，就像生活中的河流一样。

You exist in a state of abundance, where ideas lead to ever more ideas. There is always more where that came from, and you realize that the more you give away, the more comes back to you. You can afford to be generous because there is nothing you lack, and you could never exhaust the wellspring of creativity within and around you.  
你存在于一种丰富的状态中，想法会导致更多的想法。总会有更多的东西来自哪里，你会意识到你付出的越多，回报给你的就越多。你可以慷慨大方，因为你什么都不缺，而且你永远不会耗尽你内在和周围的创造力源泉。

You have the feeling that you are playing the most fun, exciting game in the world. As you teach it to others, the game gets even more fun and even more real. You can’t fail, because failure is just more information being turned into fuel for your creative process. You are unattached to any particular identity or belief, because you have so many others at your disposal.  
您会觉得自己正在玩世界上最有趣、最激动人心的游戏。当您将它教给其他人时，游戏会变得更加有趣和真实。你不能失败，因为失败只是更多的信息被转化为你创作过程的燃料。你不依附于任何特定的身份或信仰，因为你有那么多其他人可供你支配。

You have achieved Personal Knowledge Mastery. And you keep on climbing, because this mountain has no top.  
你已经达到个人知识掌握。而你继续攀登，因为这座山没有顶。
