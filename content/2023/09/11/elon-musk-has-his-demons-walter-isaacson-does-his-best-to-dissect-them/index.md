If you were trying to reverse-engineer from Elon Musk’s life a blueprint for creating the sort of tech icon who, at 52 years old, merits a 688-page biography by Walter Isaacson, the resulting plans would be fairly straightforward — just rather hard to execute.  

如果你试图从埃隆·马斯克（Elon Musk）的生活中逆向工程一个蓝图，以创造那种科技偶像，52岁，值得沃尔特·艾萨克森（Walter Isaacson）写一本688页的传记，那么由此产生的计划将相当简单 - 只是很难执行。

Take a bright, exceedingly headstrong, socially maladjusted young boy and forge his character in an abusive, friendless childhood. For solace, give him only science fiction novels, superhero comics and a cadre of younger siblings and cousins to boss around, imbuing him with delusions of grandeur and a taste for unchecked power.  

选择一个聪明、极其任性、社会适应不良的小男孩，在一个虐待、没有朋友的童年中塑造他的性格。为了安慰，只给他科幻小说、超级英雄漫画和一群弟弟妹妹和表兄弟姐妹来做老板，让他充满宏伟的妄想和对不受约束的权力的品味。

If he survives that, send him to Silicon Valley during the dot-com boom. Give him a relentless work ethic, an addiction to risk and a moral compass that puts his own interests at its magnetic north pole. Add a keen eye for brilliant engineering minds he can mine for ideas and push to achieve the seemingly impossible, while he hogs the profits and credit. And then hope that he gets very lucky at pivotal moments along the way, so that his compulsive risk-taking doesn’t blow up in his face, even when his rockets do.  

如果他活了下来，那就在互联网繁荣时期把他送到硅谷。给他一种无情的职业道德，一种对风险的沉迷，以及一个将自己的利益置于北极的道德指南针。再加上对才华横溢的工程头脑的敏锐眼光，他可以挖掘想法并推动实现看似不可能的事情，而他则占据了利润和信用。然后希望他在关键时刻非常幸运，这样他的强迫性冒险就不会在他的脸上爆炸，即使他的火箭爆炸了。

The traits that conspired to make Musk the world’s richest man were all in evidence when Isaacson decided in 2021 to make him the subject of his next biography. “Elon Musk,” being published on Tuesday, must have seemed a natural extension of Isaacson’s “great man” canon, which includes biographies of Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin and Steve Jobs. (Isaacson’s subjects are almost, though not quite, all men.)  

当艾萨克森在 2021 年决定让他成为下一本传记的主题时，使马斯克成为世界首富的合谋特征都得到了证明。周二出版的《埃隆·马斯克》（Elon Musk）似乎是艾萨克森的“伟人”经典的自然延伸，其中包括阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦、本杰明·富兰克林和史蒂夫·乔布斯的传记。（艾萨克森的拍摄对象几乎都是男性，尽管不完全是男性。

But Einstein, Franklin and Jobs were all dead by the time Isaacson’s biographies hit bookstores (albeit by just weeks in Jobs’s case), whereas Musk — CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X (formerly Twitter) — remains very alive. In the past two years, Musk’s public image has morphed from that of the hard-charging high-tech visionary who inspired Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal of Tony Stark in “Iron Man” into something more disturbing and polarizing.  

但当艾萨克森的传记在书店上映时，爱因斯坦、富兰克林和乔布斯都已经死了（尽管在乔布斯的案例中只有几周），而马斯克——特斯拉和SpaceX的首席执行官以及X（前身为Twitter）的所有者——仍然非常活着。在过去的两年里，马斯克的公众形象已经从那个激发了小罗伯特·唐尼（Robert Downey Jr.）在《钢铁侠》（Iron Man）中对托尼·斯塔克（Tony Stark）的刻画的强硬高科技梦想家的形象转变为更加令人不安和两极分化的东西。

How do you take the full measure of an increasingly troubled figure whose life’s work and legacy still hang in the balance? At stake is not just Musk’s place in history, but also his place in the present and future. If Isaacson fails to pin that down in a satisfying way, it might be because Musk is such a fast-moving target, and Isaacson prioritized revealing anecdotes and behind-the-scenes reportage over a sophisticated critical lens.  

你如何全面衡量一个日益陷入困境的人物，他一生的工作和遗产仍然悬而未决？这不仅关系到马斯克在历史上的地位，还关系到他在现在和未来的地位。如果艾萨克森未能以令人满意的方式确定这一点，那可能是因为马斯克是一个快速移动的目标，艾萨克森优先考虑揭示轶事和幕后报道，而不是复杂的批判镜头。

Fortunately, the juicy details are plentiful, especially in the book’s final third, which covers the two especially volatile years Isaacson spent shadowing Musk. (There are wild capers and personal dramas worthy of a soap opera throughout, but most of the ones you’ll encounter earlier in the book have been well documented before now, including in Ashlee Vance’s thorough 2015 Musk biography.)  

幸运的是，有趣的细节很多，尤其是在书的最后三分之一，它涵盖了艾萨克森跟随马斯克度过的两年特别动荡的岁月。（通篇都有值得肥皂剧的狂野刺山柑和个人戏剧，但你在书中前面遇到的大多数作品在此之前都有很好的记录，包括在艾希莉·万斯（Ashlee Vance）2015年详尽的马斯克传记中。

New details include that Musk single-handedly scuttled a Ukrainian sneak attack on a Russian naval fleet in Crimea (more on that below). We learn that Musk’s girlfriend Grimes was in an Austin hospital visiting a surrogate pregnant with their then-secret second child in 2021 at the same time Musk’s employee Shivon Zilis was in the same hospital pregnant with then-secret twins fathered by Musk via IVF, unbeknownst to Grimes. (“Perhaps it is no surprise,” Isaacson deadpans, “that Musk decided to fly west that Thanksgiving weekend to deal with the simpler issues of rocket engineering.”) And we discover that Musk and Grimes have a third, previously unreported child, named Techno Mechanicus Musk, bringing Musk’s tally of known offspring to 11.  

新的细节包括马斯克单枪匹马地破坏了乌克兰对克里米亚俄罗斯海军舰队的偷袭（更多内容见下文）。我们了解到，马斯克的女友格莱姆斯在奥斯汀的一家医院探望一名代孕妈妈，该代孕妈妈怀着他们当时秘密的第二个孩子，与此同时，马斯克的员工希文·齐利斯在同一家医院怀着当时由马斯克通过试管婴儿生下的秘密双胞胎，格莱姆斯不知道。（“也许这并不奇怪，”艾萨克森冷淡地说，“马斯克决定在感恩节周末向西飞行，以处理火箭工程的简单问题。我们发现马斯克和格莱姆斯有第三个以前未报告的孩子，名叫Techno Mechanicus Musk，使马斯克的已知后代总数达到11个。

This being an Isaacson biography, though, it’s clear he intends for “Elon Musk” to be more than a bunch of interesting stories about a controversial guy. He frames it as a character study, a quest to understand and perhaps reconcile the contradictions at Musk’s core. But the central question he sets out to answer in the book’s prologue feels a bit too easy. It’s the same one that lay at the heart of “Steve Jobs”: Are Musk’s personal demons and flaws also what make his spectacular achievements possible? Seven pages in, there are no prizes for guessing what Isaacson’s answer will be. Though the destination lacks suspense, the ride is entertaining enough, particularly for those who haven’t closely followed Musk’s high jinks. And despite the book’s length, it zips along thanks to Isaacson’s economical prose and short chapters.  

不过，这是一本艾萨克森传记，很明显，他打算让“埃隆马斯克”不仅仅是一堆关于一个有争议的家伙的有趣故事。他将其描述为一种性格研究，一种理解甚至调和马斯克核心矛盾的追求。但他在书序言中要回答的核心问题感觉有点太容易了。这与“史蒂夫·乔布斯”的核心相同：马斯克的个人恶魔和缺陷是否也使他的惊人成就成为可能？七页，没有奖品可以猜测艾萨克森的答案是什么。虽然目的地缺乏悬念，但这次骑行足够有趣，特别是对于那些没有密切关注马斯克高潮的人来说。尽管这本书很长，但由于艾萨克森的经济散文和简短的章节，它继续前进。

Musk, who at age 5 traipsed solo across Pretoria to reach a cousin’s birthday party after his parents left him home as a punishment, has always had a little crazy in him. To help explain it, Isaacson introduces us early on to Elon’s brutal, “Jekyll-and-Hyde” father, Errol Musk. He’s a man Elon mostly despises, but also, in his worst moments, resembles. When Musk’s first wife, Justine, reached her wit’s end with him, she would warn: “You’re turning into your father.”  

马斯克在5岁时独自穿越比勒陀利亚参加堂兄的生日派对，因为他的父母离开了他作为惩罚，他一直有点疯狂。为了帮助解释这一点，艾萨克森很早就向我们介绍了埃隆残酷的“杰基尔和海德”父亲埃罗尔马斯克。他是埃隆最鄙视的人，但在他最糟糕的时刻，他也很像。当马斯克的第一任妻子贾斯汀（Justine）与他斗智斗勇时，她会警告说：“你正在变成你的父亲。

Elon’s childhood in South Africa reads like the origin story for a superhero, or maybe a supervillain, at least as he and his family members tell it. That may be by design: Musk has a penchant for self-mythologizing, casting himself as the sole hero of complex origin stories like that of Tesla’s founding.  

埃隆在南非的童年读起来就像一个超级英雄的起源故事，或者一个超级恶棍，至少正如他和他的家人所说。这可能是有意为之：马斯克喜欢自我神话化，将自己塑造成特斯拉成立时等复杂起源故事的唯一英雄。

Already, one of the book’s critical passages has sparked geopolitical drama — and an embarrassing public walk-back by Isaacson. In an excerpt from the book [published in The Washington Post on Friday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/09/07/elon-musk-starlink-ukraine-russia-invasion/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20), Isaacson recounts how Musk single-handedly foiled a Ukrainian sneak attack on a Russian naval fleet in Crimea by cutting off the Starlink satellite internet service Ukraine’s drones were relying on. Isaacson writes that Musk made the decision because he feared the attack could lead to nuclear war, based on his conversation weeks earlier with a Russian ambassador.  

这本书的批评段落之一已经引发了地缘政治戏剧——以及艾萨克森令人尴尬的公开退路。在周五发表在《华盛顿邮报》上的一本书的摘录中，艾萨克森讲述了马斯克如何通过切断乌克兰无人机所依赖的Starlink卫星互联网服务，单枪匹马挫败了乌克兰对克里米亚俄罗斯海军舰队的偷袭。艾萨克森写道，马斯克做出这个决定是因为他担心这次袭击可能导致核战争，这是基于他几周前与俄罗斯大使的谈话。

But when CNN obtained the excerpt and reported on it, Musk tweeted a different account. He said he didn’t cut Ukraine’s Starlink service in Crimea; it was already deactivated there, and he refused the Ukrainians’ emergency request to activate it so they could carry out the attack. Isaacson tweeted Friday that Musk’s version of the story was accurate, meaning the passage in his book is misleading.  

但当CNN获得摘录并报道时，马斯克在推特上发布了一个不同的账户。他说他没有削减乌克兰在克里米亚的Starlink服务;它已经在那里停用了，他拒绝了乌克兰人的紧急请求，即激活它，以便他们可以进行袭击。艾萨克森周五在推特上说，马斯克对这个故事的说法是准确的，这意味着他书中的段落具有误导性。

The larger concern is whether Isaacson’s heavy reliance on Musk as a primary source throughout his reporting kept him too close to his subject. Swaths of the book are told largely through Musk’s eyes and those of his confidants. And the majority of tales about his exploits cast him as the genius protagonist even as they expose his self-destructive tendencies or his capacity for cruelty.  

更大的担忧是，艾萨克森在整个报道过程中严重依赖马斯克作为主要消息来源，是否使他与主题过于接近。这本书的大部分内容主要是通过马斯克和他的知己的眼睛讲述的。大多数关于他的功绩的故事都将他塑造成天才的主角，即使它们暴露了他的自我毁灭倾向或残忍的能力。

To his credit, the book boasts a large number of citations for sources and interviews. Isaacson also takes care to include corroborating or conflicting accounts of controversial episodes, such as Musk’s vicious grudge against Tesla’s original founders. (If you ever want to make an enemy for life, try standing between Musk and full credit for a project he was involved in.) And, contrary to some of his most adamant critics, Musk really does seem to possess a remarkable brain for physics, engineering and business — if perhaps not for running a social media firm. Isaacson persuasively dismisses the notion that Musk owes his success largely to inherited wealth, or that he’s a huckster profiting only from the inventions of others. Musk’s companies have thrived both because of and in spite of him.  

值得称赞的是，这本书拥有大量来源和采访的引用。艾萨克森还注意包括对有争议事件的证实或相互矛盾的描述，例如马斯克对特斯拉最初创始人的恶毒怨恨。（如果你想为人终生树敌，试着站在马斯克和他参与的一个项目的全部功劳之间。而且，与一些最坚定的批评者相反，马斯克似乎确实拥有物理学、工程和商业方面的非凡大脑——如果不是经营一家社交媒体公司的话。艾萨克森令人信服地驳斥了马斯克的成功主要归功于继承财富的观点，或者他是一个只从别人的发明中获利的小贩。马斯克的公司之所以蓬勃发展，既有他，也有他。

Isaacson at times interjects his own, sometimes dryly funny, counterpoints to some of Musk’s more outlandish claims. After he quotes Musk enthusing about his far-fetched Hyperloop plan, “This is going to change everything,” Isaacson begins the next paragraph: “It didn’t change everything.” (What it did change, by some reckonings, were California’s plans to build a high-speed rail line, which Musk has acknowledged he sought to undermine.)  

艾萨克森有时会插话，有时是干巴巴的，与马斯克的一些更古怪的说法相反。在他引用马斯克对他牵强附会的超级高铁计划充满热情之后，“这将改变一切，”艾萨克森开始了下一段：“它并没有改变一切。（根据一些估计，它确实改变了加州建设高速铁路线的计划，马斯克承认他试图破坏这一计划。

In one of his most entertaining and revealing bits of original reporting, Isaacson fills in the backstory behind a series of technical glitches that plagued Twitter in late 2022 and early 2023, and it does not disappoint.  

在他最有趣和最有启发性的原创报道之一中，艾萨克森填补了 2022 年底和 2023 年初困扰 Twitter 的一系列技术故障背后的背景故事，它并没有让人失望。

Steamrolling past Twitter employees’ warnings, Musk insisted on immediately moving thousands of the company’s computer servers from a Sacramento data center to another facility to save money. When they balked, insisting it would take months to do safely, Musk dragooned a carful of friends and family into canceling their Christmas plans to drive to Sacramento, where he personally disconnected one of the servers with the help of a security guard’s pocket knife. He then called in a team of employees to start loading the rest onto a semi truck and some moving vans.  

马斯克不顾Twitter员工的警告，坚持立即将该公司的数千台计算机服务器从萨克拉门托的数据中心转移到另一个设施，以节省资金。当他们犹豫不决，坚持需要几个月的时间才能安全完成时，马斯克拖着一车朋友和家人取消了他们开车去萨克拉门托的圣诞节计划，在那里他亲自在保安的小刀的帮助下断开了其中一台服务器的连接。然后，他召集了一队员工，开始将其余的装载到一辆半挂卡车和一些移动的货车上。

On many occasions over the years, Musk has horrified deputies with these sorts of stunts, only to be vindicated when they pay off handsomely. But in this case it turned out the employees, whom he had threatened to fire for their timidity, had been right. The move caused cascading glitches in Twitter’s software, including the ones that afflicted a highly anticipated live audio event with presidential candidate [Ron DeSantis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/candidates/ron-desantis-2024/?itid=lk_inline_manual_33) the following May.  

多年来，马斯克曾多次用这种噱头吓坏了代表们，但当他们得到丰厚的回报时，他们才得到证明。但事实证明，他因胆怯而威胁要解雇的员工是对的。此举在Twitter的软件中引起了级联故障，包括次年五月与总统候选人罗恩·德桑蒂斯（Ron DeSantis）举行的备受期待的现场音频活动。

The Musk we know today is a different one from the Musk Isaacson began following in 2021. Since then, he has lurched rightward politically, embracing conspiracies and railing that the “woke mind virus” could unravel civilization; staged a dramatic takeover of Twitter, restoring banned accounts including Donald Trump’s while alienating advertisers and the mainstream media; been accused of sexual misdeeds and revealed as the secret father of multiple additional children; founded a new AI company; and become a power broker in both the Ukraine war and Republican politics. And that’s leaving out a lot.  

我们今天所知道的马斯克与艾萨克森在 2021 年开始关注的马斯克不同。从那以后，他在政治上向右倾斜，拥抱阴谋，并指责“觉醒的心灵病毒”可以破坏文明;戏剧性地接管了Twitter，恢复了包括唐纳德·特朗普在内的被禁止的帐户，同时疏远了广告商和主流媒体;被指控性行为不端，并被揭露为多个额外孩子的秘密父亲;成立了一家新的人工智能公司;并成为乌克兰战争和共和党政治中的权力掮客。这遗漏了很多。

Isaacson pins the changes at least partly on the pandemic, which drew out Musk’s conspiratorial side, supercharged his Twitter addiction, and amped up his natural mistrust of bureaucratic regulations as covid-19 restrictions hampered Tesla production in California and China. In some ways, as Isaacson points out, Musk is becoming more like his father, Errol, whom Isaacson has found in recent years to be descending into full-on paranoia, conspiracism and overt racism.  

艾萨克森将这些变化至少部分归因于大流行，这引起了马斯克阴谋的一面，增加了他的推特成瘾，并加剧了他对官僚法规的自然不信任，因为 covid-19 限制阻碍了特斯拉在加利福尼亚和中国的生产。在某些方面，正如艾萨克森指出的那样，马斯克正变得越来越像他的父亲埃罗尔，艾萨克森近年来发现他正在陷入全面的偏执、阴谋论和公开的种族主义。

So what does Isaacson ultimately make of Elon? In a brief, final assessment, Isaacson takes us back to where he started. The tech tycoon’s “epic feats” don’t excuse his “bad behavior,” but “it’s important to understand how the strands are woven together, sometimes tightly.”  

那么艾萨克森最终会如何看待埃隆呢？在一个简短的最终评估中，艾萨克森带我们回到他开始的地方。这位科技大亨的“史诗般的壮举”并不能为他的“不良行为”开脱，但“重要的是要了解这些股线是如何交织在一起的，有时是紧密的。

A harder, but more fruitful question than how to reconcile Musk’s idealism and remarkable achievements with his “demon mode,” as Grimes calls it, might have been: What does it say about our world today that so much depends on a man like Musk? That the fate of electric vehicles, self-driving cars, public infrastructure projects, global space exploration, the rules of online discourse, and the life and death of military combatants can be altered at the whim of a notoriously whimsical man? And if he ever does go full Errol, will there be anything we can do about it?  

一个比如何调和马斯克的理想主义和非凡成就与格莱姆斯所说的“恶魔模式”更困难但更有成效的问题可能是：对于我们今天的世界，如此依赖像马斯克这样的人，这说明了什么？电动汽车、自动驾驶汽车、公共基础设施项目、全球太空探索、在线话语规则以及军事战斗人员的生死的命运可以随心所欲地改变一个臭名昭著的异想天开的人吗？如果他真的完全成为埃罗尔，我们能做些什么吗？
