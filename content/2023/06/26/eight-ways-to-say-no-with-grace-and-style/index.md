  original_title: "Eight Ways to Say No With Grace and Style"
  original_lang: en
---

In a world of more requests than we can possibly fulfill, learning how to say no with grace and style is a skill we all need.  

在一个要求多到我们无法满足的世界里，学会如何优雅而有风格地拒绝是我们都需要的技能。

We should be saying no more than we say yes, although the opposite is usually true. We say yes too quickly and no too slowly.  

我们应该说 "不 "比说 "是 "更多，尽管通常情况是相反的。我们说 "是 "的速度太快，说 "不 "的速度太慢。

> “Half of the troubles of this life can be traced to saying yes too quickly and not saying no soon enough.”  
> 
> "这一生有一半的麻烦可以追溯到太快说 "是"，而没有尽快说 "不"。

To consistently say no with grace and clarity, we need a variety of responses. To some people, this comes naturally. Others, however, offer noncommittal answers like “I’ll try to fit that in,” or “I might be able to” when they know full well they can’t.  

为了始终如一地以优雅和清晰的方式说不，我们需要各种反应。对有些人来说，这是很自然的。然而，另一些人在明知自己无法做到的情况下，却给出了 "我会尽量配合 "或 "我也许能做到 "这样不置可否的答案。

It’s far better, however, to offer a clear “no” than string someone along or give them a “slow no.”  

然而，提供一个明确的 "不"，要远远好于串联某人或给他们一个 "缓慢的不"。

In Greg McKeown’s book [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137382/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0804137382&linkId=e1f42e75b003d40faaa3401a7491c414), there is a great section called “The No Repertoire.”  

在Greg McKeown的《本质主义》一书中：少的纪律性追求》一书中，有一个很好的章节叫做 "不重复"。

> Saying no is its own leadership capability. It is not just a peripheral skill. As with any ability, we start with limited experience.  
> 
> 说 "不 "是其自身的领导能力。它不仅仅是一种外围技能。与任何能力一样，我们从有限的经验开始。

He offers eight responses you can put into your repertoire.  

他提供了八种反应，你可以将其纳入你的剧目。

## 1\. The awkward pause.  

1.尴尬的停顿。

> Instead of being controlled by the threat of an awkward silence, own it. Use it as a tool. When a request comes to you (obviously this works only in person), just pause for a moment. Count to three before delivering your verdict. Or if you get a bit more bold, simply wait for the other person to fill the void.  
> 
> 与其被尴尬的沉默的威胁所控制，不如拥有它。把它作为一种工具。当有人向你提出要求时（显然这只在人前适用），只需停顿片刻。数到三后再发表你的意见。或者，如果你更大胆一点，干脆等待对方来填补空白。

## 2\. The soft “no” (or the “no but”)  

2.柔和的 "不"（或 "不但是"）。

> I recently received an e-mail inviting me to coffee. I replied: “I am consumed with writing my book right now :) But I would love to get together once the book is finished. Let me know if we can get together towards the end of the summer.”  
> 
> 最近我收到一封邀请我去喝咖啡的电子邮件。我回复说"我现在正忙于写我的书:)但我很想在书完成后聚一聚。让我知道，如果我们能在夏天结束时聚在一起。"
> 
> E-mail is also a good way to start practicing saying “no but” because it gives you the chance to draft and redraft your “no” to make it as graceful as possible. Plus, many people find that the distance of e-mail reduces the fear of awkwardness.  
> 
> 电子邮件也是开始练习说 "不，但是 "的好方法，因为它让你有机会起草和重新起草你的 "不"，使之尽可能地优雅。此外，许多人发现，电子邮件的距离减少了对尴尬的恐惧。

## 3\. “Let me check my calendar and get back to you.”  

3."让我检查一下我的日历，然后再给你答复。"

> One leader I know found her time being hijacked by other people all day. A classic Nonessentialist, she was capable and smart and unable to say no, and as a result she soon became a “go to” person. People would run up to her and say, “Could you help with X project?” Meaning to be a good citizen, she said yes. But soon she felt burdened with all of these different agendas. Things changed for her when she learned to use a new phrase: “Let me check my calendar and get back to you.” It gave her the time to pause and reflect and ultimately reply that she was regretfully unavailable. It enabled her to take back control of her own decisions rather than be rushed into a “yes” when she was asked.  
> 
> 我认识的一位领导发现她的时间整天被其他人抢走了。她是一个典型的非本质主义者，她有能力，很聪明，不能说不，结果她很快就成了一个 "去 "的人。人们会跑到她面前说："你能不能帮我做一个X项目？"为了做一个好公民，她答应了。但很快她就感到被所有这些不同的议程所困扰。当她学会使用一个新的短语时，情况发生了变化："让我看看我的日历，然后再给你答复。"这让她有时间停顿和思考，并最终回答说她很遗憾没有时间。这使她能够重新控制自己的决定，而不是在被要求时匆匆忙忙地回答 "是"。

## 4\. Use e-mail bouncebacks  

4.使用电子邮件退信

> It is totally natural and expected to get an autoresponse when someone is traveling or out of the office. Really, this is the most socially acceptable “no” there is. People aren’t saying they don’t want to reply to your e-mail, they’re just saying they can’t get back to you for a period of time. So why limit these to vacations and holidays? When I was writing this book I set an e-mail bounceback with the subject line “In Monk Mode.” The e-mail said: “Dear Friends, I am currently working on a new book which has put enormous burdens on my time. Unfortunately, I am unable to respond in the manner I would like. For this, I apologize.—Greg.” And guess what? People seemed to adapt to my temporary absence and nonresponsiveness just fine.  
> 
> 当有人旅行或不在办公室时，收到自动回复是完全自然的，也是意料之中的。真的，这是最能被社会接受的 "拒绝"。人们并不是说他们不想回复你的电子邮件，他们只是说他们在一段时间内无法回复你。那么，为什么要把这些限制在假期和节假日呢？当我在写这本书的时候，我设置了一封主题为 "In Monk Mode "的电子邮件退信。这封邮件说"亲爱的朋友，我目前正在写一本新书，这给我的时间带来了巨大的负担。不幸的是，我无法以我希望的方式作出回应。对此，我表示歉意。你猜怎么着？人们似乎很好地适应了我的暂时缺席和不回应。

## 5\. Say, “Yes. What should I deprioritize?”  

5.说，"是的，我应该取消什么优先权？"

> Saying no to a senior leader at work is almost unthinkable, even laughable, for many people. However, when saying yes is going to compromise your ability to make the highest level of contribution to your work, it is also your obligation. In this case it is not only reasonable to say no, it is essential. One effective way to do that is to remind your superiors what you would be neglecting if you said yes and force them to grapple with the trade-off.  
> 
> 对许多人来说，在工作中向高级领导说 "不 "几乎是不可想象的，甚至是可笑的。然而，当说 "是 "会影响你对工作做出最高水平贡献的能力时，这也是你的义务。在这种情况下，拒绝不仅是合理的，而且是必要的。一个有效的方法是提醒你的上级，如果你说 "是"，你会忽略什么，并迫使他们努力权衡利弊。
> 
> For example, if your manager comes to you and asks you to do X, you can respond with “Yes, I’m happy to make this the priority. Which of these other projects should I deprioritize to pay attention to this new project?” Or simply say, “I would want to do a great job, and given my other commitments I wouldn’t be able to do a job I was proud of if I took this on.”  
> 
> 例如，如果你的经理来找你，要求你做X，你可以回应说："是的，我很乐意把这个作为优先事项。为了关注这个新项目，我应该取消其他哪些项目的优先权？"或者干脆说："我想做一份出色的工作，考虑到我的其他承诺，如果我接下这个任务，我就无法做一份我引以为豪的工作。"
> 
> I know a leader who received this response from a subordinate. There was no way he wanted to be responsible for disrupting this productive and organized employee, so he took the nonessential work project back and gave it to someone else who was less organized!  
> 
> 我认识一个领导，他从一个下属那里得到了这样的答复。他不可能负责打乱这个富有成效和组织性的员工，所以他把这个非必要的工作项目拿回来，交给了其他组织性较差的人！他说："我不知道！

## 6\. Say it with humor  

6.幽默地说出来

> I recently was asked by a friend to join him in training for a marathon. My response was simple: “Nope!” He laughed a little and said, “Ah, you practice what you preach.” Just goes to show how useful it is to have a reputation as an Essentialist!  
> 
> 最近，一位朋友邀请我和他一起参加马拉松训练。我的回答很简单："不！"他笑了一下，说："啊，你说到做到"。这恰恰说明了拥有本质主义者的名声是多么的有用!

## 7\. Use the words “You are welcome to X. I am willing to Y.”  

7.使用 "欢迎你来做X，我愿意做Y "的字眼。

> For example, “You are welcome to borrow my car. I am willing to make sure the keys are here for you.” By this you are also saying, “I won’t be able to drive you.” You are saying what you will not do, but you are couching it in terms of what you are willing to do. This is a particularly good way to navigate a request you would like to support somewhat but cannot throw your full weight behind. I particularly like this construct because it also expresses a respect for the other person’s ability to choose, as well as your own. It reminds both parties of the choices they have.  
> 
> 例如，"欢迎你来借我的车。我愿意为你确保钥匙在这里。"你这样说也是在说，"我不能载你"。你是在说你不会做什么，但你是在用你愿意做什么来表达它。这是一种特别好的方式，可以引导你想在某种程度上支持但不能全力以赴的请求。我特别喜欢这种结构，因为它也表达了对对方选择能力的尊重，以及对你自己的尊重。它提醒了双方他们的选择。

## 8\. “I can’t do it, but X might be interested.”  

8."我做不到，但X可能会感兴趣。"

> It is tempting to think that our help is uniquely invaluable, but often people requesting something don’t really care if we’re the ones who help them— as long as they get the help.  
> 
> 我们很容易认为我们的帮助是独一无二的无价之宝，但往往请求帮助的人并不真正关心我们是否是帮助他们的人--只要他们得到帮助。

Tom Friel, the former CEO of Heidrick & Struggles, once said, “We need to learn the slow ‘yes’ and the quick ‘no.’”  

海德思哲公司前首席执行官汤姆-弗里尔曾说："我们需要学习缓慢的'是'和快速的'不'"。
