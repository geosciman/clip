Happiness is an emotional state of no anxiety and fear. A feeling of satisfaction that what I am doing now is what I want to be doing.  

幸福是一种没有焦虑和恐惧的情绪状态。一种满意的感觉，即我现在所做的是我想做的。

[Mindfulness](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/mindfulness/) is the best tool I have in staying happy no matter what the circumstance is. Life is suffering and it's best to acknowledge that. In that you cannot avoid pain and hurt. Even if you try hard. You will get hurt. You will mess up and you will feel regret. It is logical then to accept these feelings as they are. No matter how bad they may feel in the moment. The key to happiness is detachment. The ability to mindfully observe the feelings and thoughts you have and _choose_ what you think is the right thing to do in the moment. The thoughts you have and feelings you feel are your body's reaction to the environment it is in.  

无论在什么情况下，正念是我保持快乐的最好工具。生活是痛苦的，最好是承认这一点。在这一点上，你无法避免痛苦和伤害。即使你很努力。你会受到伤害。你会把事情搞砸，你会感到后悔。那么，接受这些感觉是合乎逻辑的，因为它们是。无论它们在当下可能感觉多么糟糕。幸福的关键是超脱。有能力有意识地观察你的感觉和想法，并选择你认为在当下是正确的事情。你的想法和感觉是你的身体对它所处环境的反应。

Ignoring the thoughts and feelings you have is not good as it doesn't solve the problem. Only delays it and makes it worse. The thoughts and feelings will still be there. It is instead best to mindfully observe what it is you feel. Ask yourself why you feel this way? If you detach yourself from this situation and look at it from a different perspective, you will often find the reason why you feel this way. Is there anything you can do to avoid feeling like this in the future? Sometimes the sad answer is that, no you can't. The feeling may always be there due to disease or trauma. What you do have the power to change, no matter what situation life throws you in, is mindset. A change of perspective is all you need to be happy. It is your choice to be happy. Happiness is not a reaction to the environment you are in. It is a state of mind. The awareness that the negative thoughts you think about have no power over you. Because you can choose to ignore them as they bring no value to your life. The pain you feel has no power over you because it is temporary. It will go away. And you have the choice to avoid it. Controlling emotions and feelings will never work because these feelings are natural. Mindfulness and awareness is the only thing you have complete control over.  

忽视你的想法和感觉是不好的，因为它不能解决问题。只会拖延它，使它变得更糟。这些想法和感觉仍然会存在。相反，最好是用心去观察你的感受。问问自己为什么有这种感觉？如果你把自己从这种情况中分离出来，从不同的角度看，你往往会找到你有这种感觉的原因。有什么办法可以避免将来出现这样的感觉吗？有时，可悲的答案是，不，你不能。这种感觉可能由于疾病或创伤而一直存在。无论生活把你扔在什么情况下，你确实有能力改变的是心态。改变观点是你获得幸福所需要的一切。幸福是你的选择。幸福不是对你所处环境的反应。它是一种心理状态。意识到你所想的负面想法对你没有影响力。因为你可以选择忽略它们，因为它们没有给你的生活带来任何价值。你感到的痛苦对你没有力量，因为它是暂时的。它将会消失。而且你可以选择避免它。控制情绪和感觉永远不会起作用，因为这些感觉是自然的。正念和意识是你唯一可以完全控制的东西。

Aside from mindfulness and awareness, you can increase your chances of feeling happy by focusing on these three things:  

除了正念和意识之外，你可以通过关注这三件事来增加你感受到快乐的机会：

1.  Proper [diet](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/health/nutrition/)  
    
    适当的饮食
2.  [Exercise  
    
    锻炼身体](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/fitness/)
3.  Consistent [sleep](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sleep/)  
    
    稳定的睡眠

These 3 things I found to most greatly improve anything else that I want to do in life. A healthy body leads to a healthy mind.  

我发现这3件事最能大大改善我在生活中想要做的其他事情。健康的身体会带来健康的心灵。

Another point not mentioned there is _purpose_. A lack of direction in life and the constant questioning of whether what you are doing is the 'right' thing only causes more and more anxiety with time. I find [stoic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) philosophy solves this problem for me. There is no purpose to life. There is nothing in life you ought to be doing. Nothing in life you have to prove to anyone. You make your own purpose and meaning in life. I find this philosophy incredibly liberating as there is no right or wrong answer to the question of what it is you should be doing in life. If you are unhappy with what you are doing, try to change it. Don't attach yourself to anything as nothing is permanent. Value the things you have in life now. Only you can give meaning to anything. Choose wisely what matters to you and focus on that.  

那里没有提到的另一点是目的。在生活中缺乏方向，不断质疑你所做的事情是否 "正确"，只会随着时间的推移导致越来越多的焦虑。我发现斯多葛哲学为我解决了这个问题。生活没有目的。生活中没有什么是你应该做的。生活中没有什么是你必须向任何人证明的。你创造了你自己的生活目的和意义。我发现这种哲学令人难以置信的自由，因为对于你在生活中应该做什么这个问题，没有正确或错误的答案。如果你对你正在做的事情不满意，就试着去改变它。不要把自己附在任何东西上，因为没有什么是永久的。珍惜你现在在生活中拥有的东西。只有你能赋予任何东西以意义。明智地选择对你重要的东西，并专注于此。

## My personal happiness我的个人幸福 [](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/life/happiness#my-personal-happiness)

For me personally, I try to be very methodical with what makes me happy and what I value the most in life. I wrote down some [rules](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/rules) that I try my best to follow. Each of these rules came from my own experiences and failures in life. Learning from mistakes. Learning. And never looking back. I wrote these rules because I often have to remind myself of these simple things in life. Don't compare myself to other people. Be mindful. Be honest. And above all, [focus](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/). Focus on things that matter to me. Disregard the rest.  

就我个人而言，我试图非常有条不紊地处理让我快乐的事情和我在生活中最重视的事情。我写下了一些规则，我尽力去遵守。这些规则中的每一条都来自我自己的经验和生活中的失败。从错误中学习。学习。而且从不回头看。我写下这些规则是因为我经常要提醒自己生活中这些简单的事情。不要拿自己和别人比较。要有思想。要诚实。而最重要的是，要专注。专注于对我重要的事情。不理会其他的事情。

Writing it all down is helpful. But what matters is going through and being mindful enough to follow through with these rules I wrote down for myself. Being mindful of my body and thoughts and not attaching myself to needless things.  

把这一切写下来是有帮助的。但重要的是通过和足够用心来贯彻我为自己写下的这些规则。注意我的身体和思想，不要把自己附加在不必要的事情上。

One other thing I found helped me the most in life. Is expressing myself. Expressing my thoughts, feelings and frustrations. Be it through music, writing, drawing or code. I never want to hold back what I feel. I embrace it. I also find great joy in self improvement and honing [my workflow](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/sharing/my-workflow). It is an endless pursuit with no end goal in sight and that brings me happiness. Because no matter what happens in life. I can strive to improve myself. Be a better person than I was before.  

我发现还有一件事在生活中对我帮助最大。就是表达自己。表达我的想法、感受和挫折。无论是通过音乐、写作、绘画还是代码。我从来没有想过要隐瞒我的感受。我拥抱它。我还在自我改进和磨练工作流程中找到了巨大的乐趣。这是一个无止境的追求，没有终点的目标，这给我带来了快乐。因为无论生活中发生什么，我都可以努力提高自己。我都可以努力提高自己。成为一个比以前更好的人。

I love to [live minimally](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/minimalism/) and only use what I need. Think about things that matter to me. Cutting out the noise and focusing on what's important to me. I love cutting out any kind of distractions from my life. I love not keeping everything in my head and letting software and tools do the things they are good at. Storing and retrieving information. Events, todos, tasks and projects.  

我喜欢最小化的生活，只使用我需要的东西。思考对我重要的事情。剔除噪音，专注于对我重要的事情。我喜欢从我的生活中削减任何形式的分心。我喜欢不把所有事情都记在脑子里，让软件和工具做它们擅长的事情。储存和检索信息。事件、待办事项、任务和项目。

I practice this art of minimizing and focusing on what's important to me & removing everything that is not every single day.  

我每天都在练习这种最小化的艺术，专注于对我来说很重要的东西，并去除所有不重要的东西。

I also try very hard to simply not have the things that I cannot change, affect me in any meaningful way. I focus on love (giving and receiving) and appreciation (being grateful for things I have now) over hate (arguing) and being annoyed by things (not being in the moment).  

我也非常努力地不让那些我无法改变的事情以任何有意义的方式影响我。我专注于爱（给予和接受）和欣赏（对我现在拥有的东西心存感激），而不是恨（争吵）和对事情感到恼火（不在当下）。

It's harder to be [truly happy in modern online society](https://twitter.com/startingfromnix/status/1592212465747922945) as no one can go at their own pace and feel settled/good about it because there are too many avenues for comparison. There are too many people doing better, performing more, with more visibility.  

在现代网络社会中，真正的快乐更难，因为没有人可以按照自己的节奏走，并感到安定/良好，因为有太多的途径可以比较。有太多的人做得更好，表现得更多，有更多的知名度。

Just because you're going at your own pace, don't be led to think you're "under performing".  

不要因为你按照自己的速度前进，就认为你 "表现不佳"。

[Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/) did a [nice episode on science behind happiness](https://hubermanlab.com/science-based-tools-for-increasing-happiness/). Loved the part about synthetic happiness.  

胡伯曼做了一集关于幸福背后的科学的好节目。我很喜欢关于合成幸福的部分。

One important thing I always keep in my mind is that everyone has their own unique idea of what happiness is. And I can't force my happiness onto anyone. If I truly care about a person, I always try to find what that happiness for the person is and try and give it to them.  

我始终牢记的一件重要事情是，每个人都有自己对幸福的独特想法。而且我不能把我的幸福强加给任何人。如果我真正关心一个人，我总是试图找到这个人的幸福是什么，并试图把它给他们。

## Other things that help其他有帮助的事情 [](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/life/happiness#other-things-that-help)

-   Maintaining a social support network (and having a dog).  
    
    保持一个社会支持网络（和养狗）。
-   An hour of light to moderate cardio _every day_.  
    
    每天做一个小时的轻度到中度的有氧运动。
-   Focusing on hobbies.  
    
    专注于兴趣爱好。
-   Focusing on pragmatism and thoughtfulness in every action (or at least, aspiring to). Stoicism and virtue ethics.  
    
    在每一个行动中注重实用主义和深思熟虑（或至少是渴望）。斯多葛主义和美德伦理学。
-   Keep asking for help, trying new things. Someone somewhere has an answer for you. It also helps if you have someone in your life to serve as your “patient advocate”, keeping you honest, on track, to help calibrate your self reporting.  
    
    继续寻求帮助，尝试新事物。在某个地方有人会给你一个答案。如果你的生活中有人作为你的 "病人代言人"，让你保持诚实，走上正轨，以帮助校准你的自我报告，这也是有帮助的。
-   Sunlight. Get outside. Or take at least 4000 IU vitamin D.  
    
    阳光。到外面去。或服用至少4000IU的维生素D。
-   Predictable sleep patterns. Set an alarm both to wake up and go to sleep.  
    
    可预测的睡眠模式。设置一个闹钟，既可以醒来，也可以入睡。
-   Let go of societies values and expectations. If you feel a pressure to be successful, let that go. Swallow your pride, stay away from the desire to fulfill other people's expectation of you (if you can).  
    
    放弃社会的价值观和期望。如果你觉得有成功的压力，那就放手吧。咽下你的骄傲，远离满足他人对你的期望的欲望（如果你能做到的话）。
-   Help people around you. If you are a good musician, start a meetup group in a park and teach people how to play guitar. If you are good at coding, start a meetup group in the public library to teach people how to code. Limit your students to 2-3 and try to make a deep, positive impact in their lives.  
    
    帮助你周围的人。如果你是一个优秀的音乐家，在公园里成立一个聚会小组，教人们如何弹吉他。如果你擅长编码，在公共图书馆成立一个聚会小组，教人们如何编码。将你的学生限制在2-3个，并尝试在他们的生活中产生深刻、积极的影响。
-   From my experience, practicing empathy and helping others around me helped a lot. Be aware though, don't fall into the trap of trying to measure success by quantity. Its better to help 2-3 people become great than to help 100 people get average skills.  
    
    根据我的经验，练习同理心和帮助我周围的人有很大帮助。但要注意，不要落入试图以数量来衡量成功的陷阱。帮助2-3个人成为伟大的人比帮助100个人获得平均技能更好。

-   [If you have a safe place to live, food on the table and someone that loves you, you have it all. Easy to forget.

-   [I agree with you that happiness is peace. And it is a state of mind irregardless of what you experience, you can be in this peaceful state detached from emotions and feelings, only attaching yourself to things that matter to you. Mindfully observing your experience.  
    
    我同意你的观点，幸福就是和平。它是一种心态，不管你经历了什么，你都可以处于这种和平的状态，脱离情绪和感觉，只关注对你重要的事情。用心观察你的经历。](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8f52lr/my_thoughts_on_happiness/)
    -   As for its relation to neurochemistry, I most certainly agree that it plays a major role. That's why things like exercise, proper nutrition and plentiful sleep plays such a huge role in achieving and maintaining this state of happiness. Without those three things, or in other words, without you taking care of your body, reaching these states of being is simply much harder if not impossible.  
        
        至于它与神经化学的关系，我当然同意它起着主要作用。这就是为什么像运动、适当的营养和充足的睡眠在实现和保持这种幸福状态方面起着如此巨大的作用。如果没有这三样东西，或者换句话说，如果你没有照顾好你的身体，达到这些状态即使不是不可能，也是非常困难的。
