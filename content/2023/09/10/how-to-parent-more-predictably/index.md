_(As with anything else I write about parenting, this is mostly just my observations with my own two kids and may not generalize as well as I think it does.)  

(和我写的其他育儿文章一样，这主要是我对自己两个孩子的观察，可能并不像我认为的那样具有普遍性）。_

A few weeks ago I wrote about why I think it's [valuable for parents to be predictable](https://www.jefftk.com/p/predictable-parenting). I was mostly describing an end state, though, and reasons why it's a good place to be, but what should you do if you're interested in being more consistent?  

几周前，我曾写过一篇文章，谈到为什么我认为父母有预见性是有价值的。不过，我主要描述的是一种最终状态，以及为什么这是一个好地方的原因，但如果你有兴趣变得更加一致，你应该怎么做呢？

I think it breaks down into three pretty different skills. The first is only saying things you're comfortable fully standing behind. Many people especially when irritable, sleep deprived, or surprised, can quickly spit out a consequence that is harsher than is fair. Things like, "if you don't stop this minute it's no desserts for a week!" Then when the threat fails the consequence feels too extreme, and they don't follow through. If someone read my earlier post and decided they needed to stand by their quickly distributed threats I'd be pretty sad, and not expect this to make things better. Instead, any consequences need to be reasonable and proportionate, where you feel fair when you do have to enforce them (which, ideally, is rarely).  

我认为这可以细分为三种不同的技能。第一种是只说自己完全支持的话。很多人，尤其是在烦躁、睡眠不足或惊讶的时候，会很快说出比公平更严厉的后果。比如，"如果你再不收敛，就一周不准吃甜点！"然后，当威胁失败时，他们就会觉得后果过于极端，于是就不会坚持到底了。如果有人读了我之前的文章，决定要坚持他们迅速散布的威胁，我会很伤心，而且也不指望这会让事情变得更好。相反，任何后果都需要合理、适度，让你在不得不执行时（理想情况下很少）感到公平。

One thing that can be helpful is having a system of simple stock responses. The simplest is just a stern voice. If you reserve speaking firmly for rare circumstances, then saying something intensely and seriously can feel very significant.  

有一件事可能会有所帮助，那就是建立一套简单的应对系统。最简单的就是声色俱厉。如果你只在极少数情况下才说严厉的话，那么严肃认真地说一些话就会让人感觉非常重要。

Time outs can also work well: we use a system where we make it clear what needs to change ("stop shouting", "brush your teeth"), count to three, slowly and clearly, stopping if they do what we want, and if we get to three then it's time out. Serious things can be time out immediately. If you reliably use these, then not only does the kid understand how they work and what they mean but you don't have to come up with a novel appropriate response at a time when you're very stressed ("Do not bite me. That's time out.)  

超时也能起到很好的效果：我们采用的方法是，明确指出需要改变什么（"停止大喊大叫"、"刷牙"），然后缓慢而清晰地数到三，如果他们按照我们的要求做了就停止，如果数到三就超时。严重的事情可以立即暂停。如果你能稳定地使用这些方法，那么孩子不仅能理解这些方法的作用和意义，而且你也不必在自己非常紧张的时候想出一个新颖合适的应对方法（"不要咬我，这是暂停时间。）

Even better, though, is avoiding commands and threats entirely. If they've been playing with a puzzle and they ask you to read to them, you can say you'll read once they clean up the puzzle (and depending on age maybe help them clean it up). They probably want you to read badly enough that they clean up, but if not that's ok too. You're using something they want you to do as leverage to get them do something they should do, but you're also teaching them the general practice of cleaning up one thing before getting out another.  

更好的办法是完全避免命令和威胁。如果他们一直在玩拼图，要求你给他们读书，你可以说等他们收拾好拼图你就读（根据年龄也许还可以帮他们收拾）。他们可能很想让你读，以至于他们自己收拾，但如果不是这样也没关系。你在利用他们希望你做的事情作为筹码，让他们做他们应该做的事情，同时你也在教他们清理完一件事情后再拿出另一件事情的一般做法。

Similarly, don't make commitments unnecessarily. Instead of "I'll go downstairs and get your bear" maybe "I'll go downstairs and look for your bear." While with adults we understand that when a person says they'll do something they mean they'll put in a reasonable effort and may fail if the task is surprisingly difficult or if factors outside their control intervene, I find that with kids being explicit about likely failure possibilities is helpful. "I'll go see if we have any more cheese sticks." Similarly, adults understand that you don't have authority over everyone around you, but with kids phrasing like "Mama can read to you when we get home" isn't as good as "I'll ask Mama if she'll read to you when we get home." Or, even better, "when we get home you can ask Mama if she'll read to you." \[1\]  

同样，不要做出不必要的承诺。与其说 "我下楼去拿你的小熊"，不如说 "我下楼去找你的小熊"。对成年人来说，我们知道当一个人说他们会去做某件事时，他的意思是他们会付出合理的努力，如果任务出乎意料地困难，或者有超出他们控制范围的因素介入，他们可能会失败，但我发现对孩子们来说，明确地说出可能失败的可能性是很有帮助的。"我去看看还有没有奶酪棒"。同样，成年人都明白，你并不对周围的每个人都有权威，但对孩子们来说，"等我们回家后，妈妈可以给你读书 "这样的措辞不如 "等我们回家后，我问问妈妈她会不会给你读书 "好。或者，更好的说法是 "等我们回家后，你可以问妈妈是否愿意给你读书"。\[1\]

The next skill is thinking of rules that will work well in a range of situations. These can be explicit rules ("hold hands [when crossing the street](https://www.jefftk.com/p/street-training)) or implicit ones (saying yes/no without explaining reasoning but following a pattern you could explain if asked). I find thinking "saying yes/no no means saying the same thing in this sort of situation in general" is a helpful way of thinking about it. \[2\]  

下一项技能是思考在各种情况下都行之有效的规则。这些规则可以是明确的规则（"过马路时要牵手"），也可以是隐含的规则（说 "是"/"不是 "时不需要解释理由，但如果有人问起，你可以按照某种模式来解释）。我发现，"说是/否意味着在这种情况下一般都说同样的话 "是一种很有帮助的思考方式。\[2\]

This is another case where preparation can help. Before going to the beach, think about what rule you'll have for the water: "stay with a grown up the whole time", "only go in the water with a grown up", "only go in the water by yourself right in front of the lifeguard." If you notice yourself giving inconsistent answers to questions, take some time later to figure out if there's a rule that would work better ("one short video each night, after dinner"). It's ok, and expected, to end up with a rule that doesn't match some of your previous decisions, just try to get a rule you'll be happy with. ("I know we did let you stand on the table sometimes, but from now on there's no standing on the table.")  

这种情况下，做好准备工作也会有所帮助。在去海边之前，想好你下水的规则："一直和大人呆在一起"、"只和大人一起下水"、"只在救生员面前自己下水"。如果你发现自己对问题的回答前后不一致，可以花点时间想想是否有更好的规则（"每晚晚饭后看一个短视频"）。最终制定的规则与你之前的一些决定不一致是可以的，也是意料之中的，只是要尽量制定出一个让你满意的规则。(我知道我们有时会让你站在桌子上，但从现在开始不能站在桌子上。）

The easiest rules to be consistent with are the ones our culture has for adults, since you and everyone else more or less know what these are. As kids are generally less capable, tall, intelligent, prudent, etc than the people these rules have evolved for, you are going to need to make accomodations. But I find that starting with a perspective of treating kids like adults unless there is a reason otherwise works well.  

最容易保持一致的规则是我们的文化为成年人制定的规则，因为你和其他人或多或少都知道这些规则是什么。由于孩子们在能力、身高、智慧、谨慎等方面普遍不如这些规则所针对的人，所以你需要做出相应的调整。但我发现，从把孩子当成年人看待的角度出发，除非有其他原因，否则效果会很好。

The third skill is actually following through on things you've said. The better you get at the two skills above the easier this is: you're saying fewer things that need to be backed up, the consequences you've promised are ones that generally seem fair, and your kids generally understand the patterns and choose to avoid the consequences. But they will still test to see if maybe the boundary has retracted while they weren't looking, and when they do you need to be firm. Sometimes this is unpleasant for both of you but it makes the rest of your interactions far better. \[3\]  

第三个技巧是真正落实你说过的话。上述两个技巧掌握得越好，这一点就越容易：你说的需要支持的话就越少，你承诺的后果一般看起来也很公平，孩子们一般也能理解其中的规律，并选择避免后果。但他们还是会试探，看看边界是否趁他们不注意时缩回去了。有时这会让你们双方都不愉快，但这会让你们接下来的互动变得更好。\[3\]

(One way that poverty is harmful, and that parenting while well off is unfairly easy, is that external factors can keep you from being reliable for your kids. If I tell them I will do something I have enough control that I can make sure it happens, but if I had work with less flexibility, less money, or generally less slack this would be much harder. Similarly, it's much harder to be predictable when you're tired, hungry, overworked, or otherwise not at your best. If I tell my kid no and they decide to test me by tantruming, I'm going to be able to be stubborn longer than they can. But I'm only able to be in a good mental state for that because I've been lucky in how well my life has gone.)  

(贫穷是有害的，而在富裕的情况下养育孩子是不公平的）。如果我告诉他们我会去做某件事，我就有足够的控制力来确保这件事的发生，但如果我的工作没有那么灵活，没有那么多钱，或者一般来说没有那么宽松，这就难上加难了。同样，当你疲惫、饥饿、过度劳累或其他不在最佳状态时，要做到有预见性也会难得多。如果我对孩子说 "不"，而他们却决定用发脾气来考验我，那么我就会比他们固执得更久。不过，我之所以能保持良好的精神状态，是因为我的生活过得很幸运（注："幸运 "指的是我的精神状态很好）。

  

\[1\] The first version, "Mama can read to you when we get home," has a different downside which is that one parent is making a promise on behalf of another. We try very hard not to do this, and being careful about it generally makes our interactions a lot better.  

\[1\] 第一个版本 "妈妈回家后可以给你读书 "有一个不同的缺点，那就是父母一方代表另一方做出承诺。我们很努力地避免这样做，小心谨慎一般会让我们的互动变得更好。

\[2\] This is also useful for yourself. Instead of "do I want to skip exercising this morning because I'm sleepy" it works better to ask "do I want to skip exercising every morning where I'm this sleepy." Sometimes the answer is yes, often it's no, but it's much more likely to be a decision that looking back you'll think was the right one for you to make.  

\[2\] 这对你自己也很有用。与其问 "我今天早上想不想因为困而不运动"，不如问 "我想不想每天早上困的时候都不运动"。有时答案是肯定的，有时是否定的，但回过头来看，你会觉得这个决定是正确的。

\[3\] I've phrased this as about verbal consistency, but it works even when the kid is too young for words. Sleep training, for example, generally needs a bunch of thinking "I know they're really sad right now and short term would like a cuddle, but we will both be [much happier](https://www.jefftk.com/p/baby-sleep-ii) long term if they learn how to sleep on their own."  

\[3\] 我的措辞是关于语言的一致性，但即使孩子还太小不会说话，这也是有效的。比如睡眠训练，一般需要想一想："我知道他们现在很伤心，短期内想让我抱抱他们，但如果他们学会自己睡觉，从长远来看，我们都会开心得多"。
