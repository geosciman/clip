When Elon Musk announced that Twitter would become X—a “one-stop-shop” for finance and social media—many commentators were surprised. The idea seemed to come from nowhere. For those familiar with Musk’s history, however, both the name and the idea would have sounded familiar.   

当埃隆-马斯克（Elon Musk）宣布 Twitter 将成为 X--金融和社交媒体的 "一站式商店 "时，许多评论家都感到惊讶。这个想法似乎凭空而来。不过，对于熟悉马斯克历史的人来说，这个名字和想法听起来都似曾相识。

Musk is usually credited as one of the founders of PayPal. The story of the payments company’s rise and eventual sale to eBay for $1.5 billion is often elided in Musk’s own personal history. But behind that sale is a tale of obsession, ambition, and a series of brutal boardroom coups—one of which was sprung on him by Peter Thiel during his honeymoon—that, in Musk’s eyes, robbed him of both the company he originally founded and a chance to change the world.   

马斯克通常被认为是 PayPal 的创始人之一。关于这家支付公司的崛起以及最终以 15 亿美元的价格出售给 eBay 的故事，在马斯克自己的个人历史中常常被忽略。在马斯克看来，这既剥夺了他最初创立的公司，也剥夺了他改变世界的机会。

That company was X, and the world-changing idea was to create a “global financial nexus,” as Musk would describe his vision. Throughout his career, it has remained the one great idea that he feels got away. Far from being a surprise, Musk’s Twitter pivot is an attempt to revive, and finally build, that dream.  

那家公司就是 X 公司，改变世界的想法是创建一个 "全球金融纽带"，马斯克这样描述他的愿景。在他的职业生涯中，这一直是他认为被遗忘的伟大创意。马斯克在推特（Twitter）上的转折远非意外，而是他试图重拾并最终实现这个梦想。

To understand the future of X, then, it’s critical to understand its past. The rise and fall of X’s previous incarnation—and his first attempt to dominate fintech—has fallen out of his narrative. Though its history may read like an episode of _Succession_, it has defined Musk’s approach to company control and ownership ever since. Now it seems set to define the future of Twitter as well.  

因此，要了解 X 的未来，就必须了解它的过去。X 公司前身的兴衰--也是马斯克首次尝试主导金融科技的过程--已经淡出了他的叙述。虽然它的历史可能读起来像《继承者》中的一集，但从那时起，它就决定了马斯克对公司控制权和所有权的态度。现在，它似乎也将定义 Twitter 的未来。

This is the story of X, based on contemporary articles, published videos and interviews with key players such as Elon Musk and Harris Fricker, and books (including [_The PayPal Wars_](https://www.amazon.com/PayPal-Wars-Battles-Media-Planet/dp/1936488590) by Eric M. Jackson and [_The Founders_](https://www.amazon.com/Founders-Paypal-Entrepreneurs-Shaped-Silicon/dp/1501197266/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3DYQ5M6D77XUL&keywords=jimmy+soni+paypal&qid=1690554228&s=books&sprefix=jimmy+soni+paypal%2Cstripbooks%2C72&sr=1-1) by Jimmy Soni).  

这就是 X 的故事，基于当代文章、出版的视频、对埃隆-马斯克和哈里斯-弗里克等关键人物的采访以及书籍（包括《贝宝战争》（The PayPal Warsby Eric M. Jackson）和《创始人》（The Foundersby Jimmy Soni））。

### **‘The drive of a nuclear submarine’  

核潜艇的驱动力**

In late 1998, Harris Fricker, a financial securities expert, received a call from Peter Nicholson, an old boss at ScotiaBank.  

1998 年底，金融证券专家哈里斯-弗里克接到丰业银行老总彼得-尼科尔森的电话。

“‘I want you to meet this kid,’ \[Nicholson\] said,” Fricker [told the _C4K_ podcast](https://www.capitalizeforkids.org/2019/06/06/episode-14-harris-fricker/) many years later. “So I said, ‘Sure.’ I met the guy and he was incredible. Huge engine. Huge intellect. The drive of a nuclear submarine.”  

"'我想让你见见这个孩子，'（尼科尔森）说，"多年后，弗里克告诉 C4K 播客。"于是我说，'当然可以。我见到了那个家伙，他简直不可思议。巨大的引擎。巨大的智慧。核潜艇的动力"。

The “kid” had also worked for Nicholson. As an intern, he had become frustrated that his ideas for high-risk, high-reward deals weren’t implemented by the bank. Although Nicholson hadn’t acted on these ideas, he was impressed with the intern’s drive and intellect, so they stayed in touch. That was almost 10 years ago, and things had changed. The kid, now 27, was about to become a dot-com millionaire for the first time, and he contacted Nicholson to say that he was already planning his next venture. For that he needed someone who knew finance, so Nicholson pointed him to Fricker.    

这个 "孩子 "也曾为尼科尔森工作过。作为一名实习生，他对自己提出的高风险、高回报的交易想法没有被银行采纳而感到沮丧。虽然尼科尔森没有将这些想法付诸实施，但他对这位实习生的干劲和才智印象深刻，因此他们一直保持着联系。那是将近 10 年前的事了，一切都变了。他联系尼科尔森说，他已经在计划下一次创业了。为此，他需要一个懂金融的人，于是尼科尔森向他推荐了弗里克。

The kid was Elon Musk.  

那孩子就是埃隆-马斯克。

Musk bombarded Fricker with details of his new plan. Zip2, the online classifieds firm he had founded with his brother, Kimbal, was about to sell, and sell big (in February 1999, [Compaq bought it for $305 million](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/compaq-buys-zip2/)). Musk’s share would be just over $20 million, and with it, he told Fricker, he intended to launch something even bigger and more ambitious. Something the world had never seen before.  

马斯克向弗里克大肆宣扬他的新计划。他与兄弟金巴尔共同创办的在线分类信息公司 Zip2 即将出售，而且是大手笔出售（1999 年 2 月，康柏公司以 3.05 亿美元的价格收购了这家公司）。马斯克的股份只有 2000 多万美元，他告诉弗里克，他打算用这笔钱创办一个更大、更有雄心的公司。一个世界上从未见过的东西。

As Fricker listened, Musk laid out his dream. He wanted to create something that would bring all the financial aspects of a person’s life into a single place, which he referred to as an “online financial superstore.” Here, users and businesses would hold and manage everything: checking and savings accounts. Mortgages. Stocks and shares. Loans. Insurance. It would be a global financial nexus—a mega-app that users would never have to leave.  

弗里克听后，马斯克阐述了他的梦想。他想创造一种东西，把一个人生活中的所有财务问题都集中到一个地方，他称之为 "在线金融超市"。在这里，用户和企业可以持有和管理一切：支票和储蓄账户。抵押贷款。股票。贷款。保险。这将是一个全球金融枢纽--一个用户永远不必离开的大型应用程序。

Fricker was intrigued, but he was also reluctant to leave his multi-million-dollar job to help Musk chase his dream. Musk kept working on him, however, and after Compaq’s purchase of Zip2 was completed, Fricker found himself quitting his job in Canada and heading for Silicon Valley, where he became a co-founder of Musk’s new firm.  

弗里克很感兴趣，但他也不愿意离开自己价值数百万美元的工作岗位去帮助马斯克追逐梦想。不过，马斯克一直在为他努力，在康柏完成对 Zip2 的收购后，弗里克发现自己辞去了在加拿大的工作，前往硅谷，成为马斯克新公司的联合创始人之一。

“Elon knew nothing about financial services,” Fricker later told _C4K_. “But with his audacity, and his ability to articulate a vision people would get behind, it was a pretty interesting combination.”  

"埃隆对金融服务一无所知，"弗里克后来告诉 C4K。"但凭借他的胆识，以及他阐述人们会支持的愿景的能力，这是一个非常有趣的组合。"

Interesting, it soon became clear, could be both good and bad. Fricker was surprised, for example, to discover that Musk had already become fixated on a name for the company. It would be called X.   

人们很快就发现，有趣既可能是好事，也可能是坏事。比如，弗里克惊讶地发现，马斯克已经为公司确定了名字。它将被命名为 "X"。

Fricker and others expressed reservations. Banking was about trust and openness, and X hardly connoted either. Musk, however, was laser-focused on using it as the brand. He described x.com—one of the few single-letter domains registered before their use was blocked—as “the coolest URL on the internet” and informed Fricker that he’d already purchased it, giving its previous owner, Pittsburgh PowerComputer, 1.5 million shares of Series A stock in return. X marks the spot for treasure, he told a dubious Fricker and others. That’s how he saw it. That’s how others would, too. Also, it was short and easy to type, Musk said. His decision was final.  

弗里克等人对此持保留意见。银行业讲究的是信任和开放，而 X 几乎不包含这两点。然而，马斯克却专注于将其作为品牌。他把x.com--在单字母域名被禁止使用之前注册的少数几个单字母域名之一--描述为 "互联网上最酷的网址"，并告诉弗里克，他已经买下了它，作为回报，他给了它的前所有者匹兹堡电力计算机公司150万股A系列股票。他对心存疑虑的弗里克和其他人说，"X 标志着宝藏的位置"。这就是他的看法。其他人也会这么想。此外，马斯克还说，这个词简短易打。他的决定是最终决定。

Musk’s ability to override the concerns of others at X was based not only on his position as CEO of the startup, but also on the investment he had made to get it going. Although later funding rounds would dilute his share, X began with an investment of $12.5 million of Musk’s own money. As a result, the firm’s culture and goals were almost entirely driven by Musk himself.  

马斯克之所以有能力压倒 X 公司其他人的担忧，不仅因为他是这家初创公司的首席执行官，还因为他为公司的发展所做的投资。虽然后来的几轮融资会稀释他的股份，但 X 公司一开始就是马斯克自己投资了 1250 万美元。因此，公司的文化和目标几乎完全由马斯克本人推动。

It wasn’t long before the relationship between Fricker and Musk began to break down. Fricker and the financial team he’d assembled became increasingly concerned about Musk’s attitude toward regulation and verification. Musk tended to see regulation as a barrier to be eluded, rather than as something through which he needed to carefully navigate, and he insisted that growth mattered much more than inserting impediments that would prevent users from accessing X’s services.   

不久，弗里克和马斯克之间的关系开始破裂。弗里克和他组建的财务团队越来越担心马斯克对监管和核查的态度。马斯克倾向于把监管看作是一种需要躲避的障碍，而不是他需要小心驾驭的东西，他坚持认为增长比设置阻碍用户使用 X 服务的障碍重要得多。

Over time, Fricker also grew concerned that for all of Musk’s talk to the media, investors, and X employees about his grand plan, the development of actual products seemed to be proceeding slowly. Musk and his developers rejected this suggestion, insisting that the financial side of the firm didn’t understand the rapid release-and-iterate approach they planned to take. But as they headed toward a 1999 debut, Fricker and Musk frequently argued over just what would be launching. By the time X opened its digital gates, in a blaze of publicity in December of that year, Fricker was gone. He arrived at work one morning to find his computer wiped and his access suspended. Musk had fired him.  

随着时间的推移，弗里克也开始担心，虽然马斯克对媒体、投资者和 X 员工大谈他的宏伟计划，但实际产品的开发似乎进展缓慢。马斯克和他的开发人员拒绝了这一建议，坚持认为公司的财务部门并不理解他们计划采取的快速发布和迭代方法。但是，在他们向 1999 年的首次亮相迈进时，弗里克和马斯克经常为将要推出的产品争论不休。当 X 公司在当年 12 月大张旗鼓地打开数字大门时，弗里克已经离开了。一天早上，他上班时发现自己的电脑被抹掉了，访问权限也被暂停。马斯克解雇了他。

Despite the turmoil behind the scenes, at its launch X promised some interesting possibilities to those brave enough to entrust their financial lives to the internet. Following Musk’s preference for using third-party software, code, and services wherever possible, X partnered with First Western Bank and Barclays. This enabled the company to offer a form of checking account at launch, complete with bank cards and checkbooks at Musk’s insistence and—via Barclays—investment fund access.   

尽管幕后动荡不安，但 X 在发布时还是向那些敢于将自己的金融生活托付给互联网的人们承诺了一些有趣的可能性。按照马斯克尽可能使用第三方软件、代码和服务的偏好，X 与第一西方银行和巴克莱银行合作。这使得该公司在推出时就能提供一种支票账户形式，并在马斯克的坚持下提供银行卡和支票簿，还能通过巴克莱银行访问投资基金。

To encourage initial sign-ups, the company also tried something genuinely innovative for the sector: rather than investing heavily in advertising and marketing, it started paying customers to sign up. As Musk [told _CBS MarketWatch_](https://web.archive.org/web/20000302010500/http://cbs.marketwatch.com:80/archive/19991210/news/current/x.htx) at the time: “It's a very clean, simple system. There are no minimum balances. You can open an account and receive a $20 promotional offer in your checking account. You can move $8 to your S&P fund, $3 each to your money market and bond fund, and be left with $6 in your checking.”  

为了鼓励用户注册，该公司还尝试了该行业真正创新的做法：它没有在广告和营销方面投入巨资，而是开始付钱给用户注册。正如马斯克当时告诉 CBS MarketWatch 的那样："这是一个非常简洁的系统。没有最低余额限制。你可以开立一个账户，然后在支票账户中收到 20 美元的促销优惠。你可以向标准普尔基金转入 8 美元，向货币市场基金和债券基金各转入 3 美元，然后在支票账户中留下 6 美元。

Musk’s thinking behind this strategy mirrored his approach to financial risk management: move fast, drive adoption, and worry about the consequences later. For all the concern this had caused Fricker and the financial teams within X, it worked. The company’s employees watched in satisfaction as the number of X account holders began to rapidly grow.  

马斯克在这一战略背后的思考反映了他的财务风险管理方法：快速行动，推动采用，之后再担心后果。尽管弗里克和 X 公司的财务团队对此忧心忡忡，但这一策略还是奏效了。公司员工满意地看到，X 账户的持有人数开始迅速增长。

X wasn’t the only fintech startup in Silicon Valley that landed on this growth strategy. Another company—at one point based quite literally across the hall from X—was already doing the same thing. That company was Confinity.  

X 并不是硅谷唯一一家采用这种发展战略的金融科技初创公司。另一家公司--一度就在 X 公司的对面--已经在做同样的事情了。这家公司就是 Confinity。

### **The mobile wallet 移动钱包**

Confinity was the brainchild of two men: CTO Max Levchin and CEO (and major investor) Peter Thiel. A Ukrainian who had come to the U.S. to study before being bitten by the Silicon Valley bug, Levchin was a talented programmer with an eye for security. He was fascinated with the growing handheld market, and saw a gap for software that would make security and communications between devices easier.  

Confinity 是两个人的心血结晶：首席技术官 Max Levchin 和首席执行官（主要投资人）Peter Thiel。莱夫钦是一名乌克兰人，曾来美国留学，后被硅谷吸引，他是一名才华横溢的程序员，对安全问题颇有研究。他对不断增长的手持设备市场非常着迷，并看到了能让设备间的安全和通信变得更容易的软件市场缺口。

Thiel, meanwhile, was beginning to make a name for himself as a hedge fund manager and investor with an interest in technology. Levchin sought Thiel out, and the two men became friends. Levchin pitched a number of his ideas for PalmPilots—then the popular hand-held device among business users—at Thiel until eventually the investor heard one he liked. PalmPilots now came with an infrared port, which could be used to “talk” to other devices. Why not find a way to use that to send money around? Thiel, who had his own philosophical obsession with how money worked, saw promise in the idea of mobile wallets full of digital money—and the company that would become Confinity was born.  

与此同时，作为一名对冲基金经理和对技术感兴趣的投资者，蒂尔开始声名鹊起。莱夫钦找到了蒂尔，两人成了朋友。莱夫钦向蒂尔提出了他对 PalmPilots（当时在商业用户中很流行的手持设备）的许多想法，直到最后投资人听到了他喜欢的一个想法。PalmPilots 现在带有一个红外端口，可以用来与其他设备 "对话"。为什么不能想办法用它来汇款呢？泰尔对金钱的运作方式有着自己的哲学执念，他看到了装满数字货币的移动钱包的前景，于是，后来成为 Confinity 的公司诞生了。

In July 1999, Confinity launched its money-sharing service, which it called PayPal. Members of the press were invited to a launch party where a representative of Nokia Ventures, the mobile company’s investment arm, “beamed” a $4.5 million investment from his own PalmPilot to Thiel’s live on stage. A TV producer, whose cameras had failed to capture the moment, asked them to do it again.   

1999 年 7 月，Confinity 推出了名为 PayPal 的资金共享服务。媒体成员应邀参加了一个发布会，会上移动公司的投资部门诺基亚风险投资公司（Nokia Ventures）的一名代表将一笔 450 万美元的投资从自己的 PalmPilot 上 "传送 "到了台上现场的蒂尔手中。一位电视制片人的摄像机没能拍到这一时刻，于是要求他们再来一次。

“No! We cannot do it again!” a frustrated Levchin told him from backstage. “It’s millions of dollars moving from one bank to the other.”   

"不！我们不能再这样做了！"沮丧的列夫琴在后台告诉他。"这可是数百万美元从一家银行转到另一家银行"

Most of the attending press, it turned out, assumed the whole thing had been staged. In reality, Levchin and his team had been working for 36 hours to make sure Thiel’s bit of fintech grandstanding would work. Levchin was so tired that he later fell asleep at a table in the middle of the party. The venue staff gently shook him awake in the morning, telling him that everyone had left, but that Thiel had pre-paid for his breakfast.  

事实证明，与会的大多数媒体都认为整件事是在演戏。实际上，莱夫钦和他的团队已经工作了 36 个小时，以确保蒂尔的金融科技大戏能够成功。莱夫钦太累了，以至于后来在派对中间的一张桌子上睡着了。早上，会场工作人员轻轻摇醒了他，告诉他所有人都离开了，但蒂尔已经为他预付了早餐费用。

Like X, Confinity offered a financial incentive for prospective customers: if you signed up, you got $10 added to your mobile wallet. If you then persuaded a friend to sign up, they got $10, too. It wasn’t long before the number of accounts began to grow. Business circles in Silicon Valley became full of people pinging $1 transactions via PalmPilot to colleagues who had yet to register, in an effort to encourage them to sign up.  

与 X 一样，Confinity 也为潜在客户提供经济奖励：如果您注册，您的手机钱包里就会多出 10 美元。如果你说服朋友注册，他们也会得到 10 美元。不久，账户数量开始增长。在硅谷的商业圈里，很多人通过 PalmPilot 向尚未注册的同事发送 1 美元的交易信息，以鼓励他们注册。

### **The killer app 杀手级应用**

While both X and Confinity fell under the category of financial services, neither firm initially saw the other as a direct competitor. Musk was ruthlessly focused on his goal of making X a one-stop-shop for all things financial. Confinity wanted to help people move and manage money on their hand-held devices. The situation changed, however, when both firms accidentally and independently created the same “killer” app—the ability to send payments from one email address to another.  

虽然 X 和 Confinity 都属于金融服务范畴，但两家公司最初都没有把对方视为直接竞争对手。马斯克无情地专注于将 X 打造成一站式金融服务的目标。而 Confinity 则希望帮助人们在手持设备上移动和管理资金。然而，当两家公司意外地独立开发出相同的 "杀手级 "应用--从一个电子邮件地址向另一个电子邮件地址发送付款的功能时，情况发生了变化。

At Confinity, the realization that this might be the future began to grow even before the product’s official launch. For a while, Thiel had been trying to persuade David Sacks, an ex-McKinsey consultant and friend, to join the company. Sacks asked what the product did, and Thiel explained the idea of “beaming” money. Sacks was lukewarm on the idea, believing the growth ceiling for such a product was low. Almost as an aside, Thiel mentioned that Levchin had also built a way for people to send money to another email address via the website, in case users had left their PalmPilot at work or home.  

在 Confinity，人们甚至在产品正式发布之前就开始意识到这可能就是未来。有一段时间，蒂尔一直在努力说服大卫-萨克斯（David Sacks）加入公司，他曾是麦肯锡公司的顾问，也是蒂尔的朋友。萨克斯问该产品是做什么的，蒂尔解释了 "传送 "资金的想法。萨克斯对这个想法不置可否，认为这种产品的增长上限很低。泰尔几乎是旁敲侧击地提到，莱夫钦还建立了一种方法，让人们可以通过网站向另一个电子邮件地址汇款，以防用户把 PalmPilot 忘在公司或家里。

“Wait,” Sacks said. “_That’s_ the product.” Intrigued, he joined the company on the condition that Confinity explore this avenue further.  

"等等，"萨克斯说"这就是产品"。他很感兴趣，于是加入了公司，条件是 Confinity 必须进一步探索这一途径。

Levchin, focused on PalmPilots, remained unconvinced. So did others at Confinity. But in April 1999, a single email triggered a tidal wave of change.   

专注于 PalmPilots 的列夫钦仍然不以为然。Confinity 的其他人也是如此。但 1999 年 4 月，一封电子邮件引发了变革浪潮。

The email was from a power-seller on a hot startup auction site called eBay. The user explained that eBay did not have a native payment system, so they, and other sellers, had begun using PayPal for all their sales. The pay-by-email function made it so easy to transfer money, so to highlight it as an option and boost their sales, they wanted to include a PayPal logo on their listings. The image on the PayPal website was too big, though, and they didn’t know how to resize it. Was there any chance Confinity could send them a smaller one?  

这封邮件来自一家名为 eBay 的热门初创拍卖网站上的实力卖家。该用户解释说，eBay 没有本地支付系统，因此他们和其他卖家开始使用 PayPal 进行所有销售。邮件支付功能让转账变得非常容易，因此为了突出这一功能并提高销售额，他们希望在自己的列表中加入 PayPal 徽标。但 PayPal 网站上的图片太大，他们不知道如何调整大小。Confinity能不能给他们发一张小一点的？

Forwarded by the customer service team to Levchin and the other developers, the email set off a chain of events that revealed just how many eBay users were already using PayPal. To these users, the sign-up offer made adoption of the service a no-brainer. It wasn’t just that transferring money via PayPal was easy. It was the value of the sign-up offer. Most buyers didn’t have a PayPal account, while most sellers did. If the seller could persuade the buyer to set up an account with their referral link, the buyer would effectively save $10 on their purchase, while the seller would make an additional $10 on the sale.  

客户服务团队将这封邮件转发给 Levchin 和其他开发人员后，引发了一系列事件，揭示了有多少 eBay 用户已经在使用 PayPal。对这些用户来说，注册优惠让他们毫不犹豫地选择了这项服务。这不仅仅是因为通过 PayPal 转账很容易。而是注册优惠的价值。大多数买家没有贝宝账户，而大多数卖家有。如果卖方能说服买方使用他们的推荐链接建立一个账户，买方就能在购买时节省 10 美元，而卖方则能在销售时多赚 10 美元。

This revelation proved Sacks was right. Wasting no time, Thiel and Sacks persuaded a reluctant Levchin that they had to fully pivot the product. PalmPilots were out. Pay-by-email would be the company’s main focus now.  

事实证明，萨克斯是对的。蒂尔和萨克斯毫不犹豫地说服了不情愿的列夫琴，他们必须完全改变产品的方向。PalmPilots 被淘汰了。电子邮件付费将是公司现在的主要关注点。

Over at X, meanwhile, the path to email payments was similar. Musk had identified it as a useful part of his financial nexus, and his developers had duly built it. X’s own sign-up offer also meant that once it was available, X, too, started to benefit from the eBay effect. Unlike the Confinity founders, Musk had no desire to pivot his whole company to this new focus. His eyes remained ever-fixed on becoming the internet’s financial nexus. But pay-by-email was driving usage in a way no other service in the X family was, and Musk recognized that this made it an important part of the company.   

与此同时，在 X 公司，电子邮件支付的发展道路也很相似。马斯克将其视为金融纽带的一个有用部分，而他的开发人员也顺理成章地构建了这一纽带。X 公司自己提供的注册服务也意味着，一旦它可用，X 公司也开始从 eBay 效应中受益。与 Confinity 的创始人不同，马斯克并不想把整个公司转向这个新的焦点。他的目光始终紧盯着成为互联网的金融纽带。但是，邮件付费正在以 X 系列其他服务所没有的方式推动着用户的使用，马斯克认识到，这使其成为公司的重要组成部分。

It also made Confinity a rival—one he was determined to beat.  

这也让 Confinity 成为了一个对手--一个他决心要打败的对手。

### **From enemies to lovers 从敌人到恋人**

Both X and Confinity realized that in order to succeed, their products would need to benefit from the network effect of users around a de facto standard. Dominating the market early was critical.  

X 和 Confinity 都意识到，要想取得成功，他们的产品就必须受益于围绕事实标准的用户网络效应。尽早主导市场至关重要。

Over the next few months, in a cut-throat quest to achieve supremacy, a vicious rivalry developed between the two companies. They became locked in a spending spree in a desperate effort to continue high levels of growth. X increased its signup offer; Confinity responded the same way. While both companies’ user numbers climbed, every one of those customers was costing them—or rather, their investors—money.  

在接下来的几个月里，为了争夺市场份额，两家公司之间形成了恶性竞争。为了继续保持高增长，两家公司不惜大肆挥霍。X 增加了注册优惠；Confinity 也采取了同样的对策。虽然两家公司的用户数量都在攀升，但每一个客户都在让他们--或者说是他们的投资者--损失金钱。

Both companies struggled to find a way to make their services generate revenue. For X, few users showed much interest in accessing its other financial services, which was how Musk intended to make a profit. The story was no better at Confinity. Thiel’s assumption had been that users would leave money in their PayPal accounts, allowing Confinity to make money through interest on deposits it held on behalf of its users. This was one of the key reasons the company didn’t charge a fee on money transfers. But the amount of money users were leaving in their PayPal wallets remained worryingly low.  

两家公司都在努力寻找让自己的服务创收的方法。对于 X 公司来说，很少有用户对使用其其他金融服务表现出浓厚的兴趣，而这正是马斯克打算盈利的方式。Confinity 的情况也好不到哪里去。泰尔的假设是，用户会把钱留在他们的贝宝账户里，这样 Confinity 就可以通过代用户存款的利息来赚钱。这也是该公司不收取转账费用的重要原因之一。但是，用户留在 PayPal 钱包里的钱仍然少得令人担忧。

As the year 2000 approached, the financial burn rate at both X and Confinity grew dangerously. Musk didn’t see a problem with this. He wanted to win. He knew X had deeper pockets than Confinity, so its financial runway was longer. Besides, if he wanted more money he’d just go back to the market—indeed, in early 2000 X had already begun the process of kicking off another funding round.  

随着 2000 年的临近，X 公司和 Confinity 公司的财务烧钱速度越来越快，非常危险。马斯克并不觉得这有什么问题。他想赢。他知道 X 公司比 Confinity 公司有更多的资金，所以它的财务周期更长。此外，如果他想要更多的钱，他只需回到市场上--事实上，在 2000 年初，X 公司就已经开始了新一轮的融资过程。

Unfortunately for Musk, he was no longer the sole power behind X. In the quest for funding, X had acquired additional backers and investors during previous rounds that he needed to answer to—most notably, Mike Moritz of Sequoia Capital.  

对马斯克来说，不幸的是，他不再是 X 背后的唯一力量。在寻求资金的过程中，X 在之前的几轮融资中获得了更多的支持者和投资者，他需要对这些支持者和投资者做出回应，其中最引人注目的是红杉资本的迈克-莫里茨（Mike Moritz）。

When Moritz brought Sequoia onboard, it was with one stipulation—that Musk step back from the role of CEO. Musk could still drive product strategy, Moritz said, but the company was growing, and it needed an experienced hand on the tiller—especially because there were rumors among investors that X had a culture of coding first, and worrying about regulators and risk later. Moritz warned Musk that a calm and trusted figure at the top would likely be required to attract further investment.  

当莫里茨邀请红杉加入时，有一个条件--马斯克必须从首席执行官的位置上退下来。莫里茨说，马斯克仍然可以推动产品战略，但公司正在成长，需要一个经验丰富的人来掌舵--尤其是因为投资者中有传言说，X 公司的文化是先编码，后担心监管机构和风险。莫里茨警告马斯克，要想吸引更多投资，高层很可能需要一个冷静而值得信赖的人物。

Keen to focus on his grand plan and the technology required to achieve it, Musk saw no harm in Moritz’s proposal. He was still the majority owner of the company, so he felt confident that a new CEO posed no risk to his control.  

马斯克希望专注于他的宏伟计划和实现该计划所需的技术，他认为莫里茨的提议没有坏处。他仍然是公司的大股东，因此他相信新任首席执行官不会对他的控制权构成风险。

Musk stepped back from the role of CEO at the end of 1999. In came Bill Harris, a well-respected financial veteran from Intuit. Almost immediately, the value of the appointment became clear. In January 2000 news broke about a security flaw in X that allowed fraudsters to transfer money from _anyone’s_ account with just basic account information. The bug had already been fixed by the time it became public, just as X was trying to complete another funding round. Moritz was right: had Harris not been CEO, many of the investors X was courting would have walked away. Musk was relieved and pleased. He would not remain that way for long.  

1999 年底，马斯克从首席执行官的位置上退了下来。比尔-哈里斯（Bill Harris）走马上任，他是 Intuit 公司备受尊敬的财务老将。几乎是一瞬间，这一任命的价值就显现出来了。2000 年 1 月，有消息称 X 存在安全漏洞，欺诈者只需提供基本账户信息，就能从任何人的账户中转移资金。当这个漏洞被公开时，它已经被修复了，而此时 X 正试图完成另一轮融资。莫里茨是对的：如果哈里斯不是首席执行官，X 公司正在争取的许多投资者都会离开。马斯克松了一口气，也很高兴。但他并没有高兴太久。

### **‘A gun to my head’  

用枪指着我的头**

As the new millennium dawned and Musk was working to raise new funds at X, Thiel was busy imparting some hard truths to Levchin. It was Thiel’s firm belief that though Confinity had the better product and greater market share, they were going to lose the war with X. Thiel’s reasoning was simple: they were going to run out of money first.   

新千年来临之际，马斯克正努力为 X 筹集新资金，而蒂尔则忙着向列夫钦传授一些硬道理。蒂尔坚信，虽然 Confinity 拥有更好的产品和更大的市场份额，但他们会在与 X 的战争中败下阵来。

Looking at the markets, Thiel realized that a tech crash was coming—which would prove to be correct. He was sure that Confinity, like X, could complete another funding round, but he predicted it would be the last major investment both companies would see for a while. They would need to create enough runway not only to allow them to outspend X but also to _survive_. If both companies stayed at war, Thiel argued, mutually assured destruction would be the only outcome.  

展望市场，蒂尔意识到科技股即将崩盘--事实证明他的判断是正确的。他确信，Confinity 也能像 X 一样完成新一轮融资，但他预测，这将是这两家公司在一段时间内看到的最后一笔重大投资。他们需要创造足够的发展空间，不仅让他们能够超越 X，而且还能生存下去。蒂尔认为，如果两家公司继续交战，那么唯一的结果就是相互毁灭。

With Levchin’s reluctant support, Thiel reached out to X to float the idea of a merger. Given the hatred the two companies had built up for each other, he did not expect a response. To his surprise, he found himself talking to someone who agreed with him: Bill Harris. Harris, too, was desperately worried about the unsustainability of X’s burn rate. He reached a similar conclusion as Thiel: the two companies were killing each other. Yes, X could likely outlast its rival, but not without fatally wounding itself.  

在 Levchin 不情愿的支持下，Thiel 向 X 提出了合并的想法。考虑到两家公司之间的仇恨，他并不指望得到回应。出乎他意料的是，他发现自己竟然和一个同意他观点的人聊了起来：比尔-哈里斯。哈里斯也非常担心 X 公司的烧钱速度难以为继。他得出了与泰尔相似的结论：两家公司正在互相残杀。是的，X 有可能超越对手，但不可能不对自己造成致命伤。

The two men met and reached an agreement: X and Confinity needed to merge.  

两人见面后达成了协议：X 和 Confinity 需要合并。

When Musk was told the news, his reaction bordered on the explosive. He did recognize, however, the validity of the arguments being made. He agreed to let negotiations take place, although he insisted on opening with an offer that would see a 92/8 stock split in X’s favor. When Harris and Musk met Thiel and Levchin to present this, Levchin was so angry that he stood up and left. Away from the table, he told Thiel to call the whole thing off. Thiel told him to calm down. Time and investor pressure, Thiel insisted, was on their side. All they had to do was wait, and X would be back with better terms.  

当马斯克得知这一消息时，他的反应近乎爆炸。不过，他也承认对方的论点是有道理的。他同意进行谈判，但他坚持开出的条件是，X 公司将以 92/8 的比例拆分股票。当哈里斯和马斯克与蒂尔和列夫琴会面提出这一方案时，列夫琴非常生气，站起来就走了。离开谈判桌后，他告诉蒂尔取消整个谈判。蒂尔让他冷静下来。蒂尔坚持说，时间和投资者的压力都站在他们一边。他们要做的就是等待，X 会带着更好的条件回来。

Thiel was right. By the end of February 2000, the two sides were looking at a 55/45 merger. Levchin was still unhappy but told Thiel that he would reluctantly accept it. That was the case until, on a visit to X’s offices, Musk told Levchin that Confinity was getting “a f\*\*king deal.”  

蒂尔是对的。到 2000 年 2 月底，双方达成了 55/45 的合并方案。莱夫钦仍然很不高兴，但他告诉蒂尔，他会勉强接受。直到一次拜访 X 公司办公室时，马斯克告诉列夫钦说，Confinity 得到了 "一笔该死的交易"。

“My blood just boiled, and so I thought, _it’s off_,” Levchin remembered later. It took some frantic damage control on the part of Harris and Thiel to get Levchin back on board with the idea. Musk’s contempt would also cost X another five points on the split. Levchin only agreed to sign off if the split was amended to 50/50.  

"莱夫钦后来回忆说："我热血沸腾，心想，这下完了。哈里斯和蒂尔采取了一些疯狂的损害控制措施，才让列夫钦重新接受了这个想法。马斯克的蔑视也让 X 公司在分账上又损失了 5 分。只有将分成比例修改为 50/50，莱夫钦才同意签字。

Musk, meanwhile, was now adamant he wouldn’t sign off on the merger at all. His dream was to build a global financial nexus. That wasn’t Confinity’s dream, and he didn’t need its PayPal product to do it. Nor did he feel like Confinity was anywhere close to X’s equal in value. He’d felt a 92/8 split was generous. The idea of a 50/50 one was laughable.  

与此同时，马斯克现在坚决表示，他根本不会同意合并。他的梦想是建立一个全球金融纽带。这不是 Confinity 的梦想，他也不需要它的 PayPal 产品来实现这个梦想。他也不觉得 Confinity 与 X 的价值相当。他觉得 92/8 的分成比例已经很慷慨了。50/50 的想法太可笑了。

Musk has never hid his contempt for the merger, talking openly about his desire not to see it completed. “I was like, f\*\*k you. We’re just going to kill them,” Musk said in an interview about his attitude after Harris confirmed the new terms.  

马斯克从不掩饰自己对合并的蔑视，他公开表示不希望看到合并完成。"我当时想，去你妈的。在哈里斯确认新条款后，马斯克在一次采访中谈到了他的态度。

Musk was confident that this was the end of the discussion. He held the controlling interest in X, after all. What he hadn’t counted on was Harris’s determination to push it through.   

马斯克相信，讨论到此为止。毕竟，他拥有 X 公司的控股权。但他没有想到的是，哈里斯下定决心要推动此事。

The company’s current funding round depended on the confidence attached to the presence of Bill Harris, and Harris knew it. So Harris went to Musk and told him to sign off on the merger, or Harris would quit. Musk was furious but knew the damage Harris’s resignation would do at that time.  

公司本轮融资有赖于比尔-哈里斯（Bill Harris）的信任，而哈里斯对此心知肚明。于是，哈里斯找到马斯克，让他签字同意合并，否则哈里斯就辞职。马斯克勃然大怒，但他知道哈里斯辞职在当时会造成多大的损失。

“You’re basically putting a gun to my head,” Musk later remembered telling Harris.  

"你基本上是在用枪指着我的头，"马斯克后来记得对哈里斯说。

It worked. In March 2000, X and Confinity merged, with Harris as CEO of the new firm, which kept the X name.  

它成功了。2000 年 3 月，X 公司和 Confinity 公司合并，哈里斯出任新公司的首席执行官，新公司保留了 X 的名称。

### **Musk takes the reigns again  

马斯克再次掌权**

Harris’s reign as CEO over the newly-merged company was short-lived. Within five months, he was out. Levchin, Thiel, and Musk were all strong personalities, but they shared a belief in the power of paying the customer to sign up. When Harris tried to put an end to this tactic in an attempt to reduce the amount of money the company was hemorrhaging each month, Thiel vehemently disagreed. A rift formed between the two men.  

哈里斯担任新合并公司首席执行官的时间很短。不到五个月，他就下台了。莱夫钦、蒂尔和马斯克都个性鲜明，但他们都坚信向客户付费注册的力量。当哈里斯试图终止这种策略，以减少公司每月的亏损额时，蒂尔坚决不同意。两人之间产生了裂痕。

Musk had never forgiven Harris for forcing the merger and spotted an opportunity to act. There were six members on the new company’s board: founders Musk, Thiel, and Levchin; and Moritz, John Malloy, and Tim Hurd, who represented major investors. Knowing Thiel would likely break his way in a vote, Musk enlisted Levchin’s help to stage a coup. They gathered signatures from the development team on a letter of mass resignation and presented it to the other board members at an emergency meeting. If Harris didn’t resign, Musk said, then both he and Levchin would walk, and so would most of the development team.  

马斯克一直没有原谅哈里斯强行合并的行为，他发现了一个采取行动的机会。新公司的董事会有六名成员：创始人马斯克、蒂尔和列夫琴，以及代表主要投资者的莫里茨、约翰-马洛伊和蒂姆-赫德。马斯克知道蒂尔很可能会在投票中不按常理出牌，于是他找来莱夫钦帮忙发动政变。他们收集了开发团队在一封集体辞职信上的签名，并在一次紧急会议上提交给其他董事会成员。马斯克说，如果哈里斯不辞职，那么他和莱夫钦都会辞职，开发团队的大部分成员也会辞职。

The ultimatum worked. Harris was forced to resign, and in May 2000 Musk took over again as CEO, with Levchin becoming CTO.  

最后通牒起了作用。哈里斯被迫辞职，2000 年 5 月，马斯克再次接任首席执行官，莱夫钦成为首席技术官。

For Musk, this represented the summit of his power at X. He believed it presented an opportunity to refocus the company on his plan to create a global one-stop-shop for financial services, of which pay-by-email was just one small part. Yes, the company was still burning money, but he didn’t believe that he should have to compromise his vision. To save money and help attract new investors, the company needed to streamline its development processes, use more third-party services, and focus on converting PayPal users to X’s other services.   

对马斯克来说，这代表着他在 X 公司的权力巅峰。他认为，这为他提供了一个机会，可以让公司重新专注于他的计划，即创建一个全球性的一站式金融服务，而邮件支付只是其中的一小部分。是的，公司仍在烧钱，但他认为自己不应该妥协于自己的愿景。为了节省开支并吸引新的投资者，公司需要简化开发流程，使用更多的第三方服务，并专注于将 PayPal 用户转化为 X 的其他服务。

### **The PayPal V2 disaster PayPal V2 灾难**

Musk’s new-found alliance with Levchin barely lasted a month. Before the merger, Confinity and X had pursued approaches to code and infrastructure that were polar opposites. Musk set X up as a Microsoft house, buying and using off-the-shelf products and frameworks to ship quickly and keep his development team small. In contrast, Levchin believed that while it required a lot more people and effort, open-source software and Linux was the way to go. It allowed PayPal to scale and adapt better.  

马斯克与列夫钦的新联盟仅仅维持了一个月。在合并之前，Confinity 和 X 在代码和基础架构方面的做法截然相反。马斯克把 X 想象成微软公司，购买并使用现成的产品和框架，以便快速交付，并保持小规模的开发团队。与此相反，Levchin 认为开源软件和 Linux 虽然需要更多的人力和精力，但才是王道。它使 PayPal 能够更好地扩展和适应。

Over the objections of Levchin, Musk ordered that all new feature development on PayPal must stop. Instead, the developers should focus on creating “PayPal V2”: a complete rebuild, from the ground up, using Microsoft products and services.  

在列夫钦的反对下，马斯克下令必须停止 PayPal 的所有新功能开发。取而代之的是，开发人员应该专注于创建 "PayPal V2"：使用微软的产品和服务，从头开始彻底重建。

This decision alienated Levchin and the ex-Confinity developers, who felt that it unnecessarily discarded the Confinity codebase for the sake of conforming to Musk’s preferences. The longer the project continued, the clearer it also became that Microsoft had over-promised about what its products could do at the time. Multiple major issues, including serious memory leaks, emerged during testing. V2 simply couldn’t operate at the level required to run PayPal. It was also taking far longer to rewrite the codebase than Musk had anticipated.  

这一决定疏远了列夫钦和前 Confinity 开发人员，他们认为，为了迎合马斯克的喜好，微软不必要地放弃了 Confinity 代码库。项目持续的时间越长，微软当时对其产品功能的过度承诺就越明显。测试过程中出现了多个重大问题，包括严重的内存泄露。V2 根本无法达到运行 PayPal 所需的水平。重写代码所花费的时间也远远超出了马斯克的预期。

The deadline for implementing PayPal V2 and unfreezing product improvement and development came and went. In an effort to speed things up, Musk offered bonus bounties if key milestones were met. He should have taken it as a ominous sign that, despite their efforts, the development teams couldn’t meet them. Nonetheless, Musk doubled down on his plan over Levchin’s objections. He set a hard deadline at which point PayPal V2 would be rolled out, ready or not. He also decreed that no provision for rollback to the Linux version was to be made. Once live, it would stay live—whether it worked or not.  

实施 PayPal V2 和解冻产品改进与开发的最后期限来了又走。为了加快进度，马斯克在关键的里程碑上悬赏奖金。他本应该把这看作是一个不祥的信号，因为尽管开发团队付出了努力，但还是无法实现这些目标。尽管如此，马斯克还是不顾列夫钦的反对，加倍推进他的计划。他为 PayPal V2 设定了一个严格的最后期限，无论是否准备就绪，都必须在这一期限之前推出。他还规定，不得回退到 Linux 版本。一旦上线，就将保持上线状态，不管它是否能正常运行。

### **Laser-focused on the grand plan  

专注于宏伟计划**

In addition to alienating many on the development team, Musk had no intention of letting them focus on the pay-by-email market—or, indeed, of letting PayPal be PayPal. The goal was to create a global financial nexus, so PayPal needed to be subsumed and used to drive the uptake of X’s other financial services. That was the sole value he saw in the company.  

除了疏远开发团队中的许多人之外，马斯克也无意让他们专注于邮件支付市场，或者说，让 PayPal 成为 PayPal。马斯克的目标是创建一个全球金融纽带，因此 PayPal 必须被纳入其中，并用来推动 X 的其他金融服务的普及。这就是他眼中公司的唯一价值。

To this end, Musk ordered that the paypal.com URL be redirected to x.com and a full rebrand of PayPal begin. The overhaul included the replacing of PayPal’s name with X-PayPal and its logos.  

为此，马斯克下令将 paypal.com 网址重定向到 x.com，并开始全面重塑 PayPal 品牌。这次改造包括用 X-PayPal 取代 PayPal 的名称及其标识。

These decisions horrified many on the product and marketing teams, including head of payments Reid Hoffman. They had all become critically aware of what their eBay users—on whom their perceived path to profit almost entirely depended—wanted, and it wasn’t X.  

这些决定吓坏了产品和营销团队的许多人，包括支付主管里德-霍夫曼（Reid Hoffman）。他们都深刻地意识到，他们的 eBay 用户--他们认为盈利之路几乎完全依赖于他们的用户--需要的不是 X。

PayPal strategy analyst Vivien Go—who had led a branding survey with users—recalled just how badly X tested whenever focus groups were run. "Again and again, the theme of 'Oh God, I wouldn't trust this website,” she told Jimmy Soni in an interview for his book _Founders_. “‘It's an adult website' and 'I just wouldn't trust that.’"  

贝宝（PayPal）战略分析师薇薇安-戈（Vivien Go）曾领导过一项针对用户的品牌调查，她回忆说，每次焦点小组讨论时，X 的测试结果都很糟糕。"她在接受吉米-索尼（Jimmy Soni）为其著作《创始人》（Founders）所做的采访时说："一次又一次，主题都是'哦，上帝啊，我不会相信这个网站'。"'这是一个成人网站'，'我就是不会相信这个网站'"。

Musk ignored the focus group evidence and insisted that they push ahead with the changes.  

马斯克无视焦点小组的证据，坚持推进改革。

### **Running out of runway 没有跑道**

The issues with the development, product, and marketing teams were not enough to topple Musk from power on their own. Perhaps ironically, it was the other financial services he was so keen to push that played the final part in his downfall.  

开发、产品和营销团队的问题本身并不足以让马斯克下台。也许具有讽刺意味的是，他热衷于推动的其他金融服务才是他最终倒台的原因。

From its launch, Musk insisted on a culture of growth over verification for X’s financial services. While this ensured rapid adoption, it meant that minimal checks were being made on fake sign-ups and fraud. Once it became clear that an X account could be opened easily—granting access to debit cards, check books, and credit—fraud became a serious issue.  

从推出开始，马斯克就坚持在 X 的金融服务中推行 "增长大于验证 "的文化。这虽然确保了服务的快速普及，但也意味着对虚假注册和欺诈行为的检查力度微乎其微。一旦人们发现 X 账户可以轻松开设，并能使用借记卡、支票簿和信用卡，欺诈就成了一个严重的问题。

Ken Miller, who had been brought in to try and help with fraud issues, later recalled some of X’s major problems. “It’s like, ‘Oh cool. First Name: Mick. Middle initial: E. Last name: Mouse. Perfect. Oh, and they sent a transaction for $2,700. Perfect,’” he said. “_And_ we gave them a line of credit.”  

肯-米勒（Ken Miller）被请来帮助解决欺诈问题，他后来回忆了 X 的一些主要问题。"就像'哦，酷。名字：米克中间名缩写：E：姓：老鼠。好极了哦，他们还送来了一笔 2700 美元的交易。完美，'"他说。"我们给了他们一个信用额度。

These issues weren’t entirely unknown to Confinity pre-merger, but the scale was greater than many had realized. Fraud was also increasing, not decreasing, as Musk rejected almost every effort to deal with it that would have harmed growth.  

合并前的 Confinity 并非完全不知道这些问题，但其规模之大超出了许多人的想象。欺诈行为也在增加，而不是减少，因为马斯克拒绝了几乎所有会损害增长的应对措施。

In the summer of 2000, X’s financial wizard and until then a Musk loyalist, Roelof Botha, discovered that X’s exposure—and likely losses—were even greater than previously thought. Under pressure, Musk had agreed to sunset a number of products in the X range that extended credit to high-risk accounts. The value of the interest on that credit was likely non-existent, as was the chance of ever receiving repayment. Yet Botha realized that both were still being counted as income on which X could rely in the coming months.  

2000 年夏天，X 公司的财务向导、马斯克的忠实拥护者 Roelof Botha 发现，X 公司面临的风险和可能的损失比之前想象的还要大。迫于压力，马斯克同意将 X 系列中的一些向高风险账户提供信贷的产品销声匿迹。这种信贷的利息价值很可能不存在，收到还款的可能性也不大。然而，博塔意识到，在未来几个月里，这两项收入仍然是 X 可以依赖的收入。

Botha took the numbers to Thiel, who was already concerned about the company’s finances. X was burning over $12 million a month and had less than $70 million left in the bank. Its ability to raise further funding was shrinking. A potentially disastrous PayPal V2 rollout, combined with this growing risk exposure, might make it impossible. Thiel decided it was time to act.  

博塔把这些数字告诉了泰尔，泰尔已经开始担心公司的财务状况。X 公司每月烧掉的资金超过 1200 万美元，银行存款不足 7000 万美元。公司进一步融资的能力正在减弱。PayPal V2 的推出可能会带来灾难性的后果，再加上不断增加的风险敞口，可能会导致公司无法继续融资。泰尔决定是时候采取行动了。

### **The Confinity coup Confinity 政变**

Just who was responsible for making the first move in what became known as the “Confinity coup” remains up for debate. In most accounts, it was Thiel. Certainly, once it was underway, it was Thiel who ensured it succeeded. Eric M. Jackson, however, who was working at X at that time, claims in his book _The PayPal Wars_ that it was Levchin who made the first move, sounding out Sacks and others before going to Thiel for support.  

在这场被称为 "Confinity 政变 "的行动中，究竟是谁先下手为强，至今仍有争议。大多数人认为是蒂尔。当然，在政变开始后，是蒂尔确保了政变的成功。不过，当时在 X 公司工作的埃里克-杰克逊（Eric M. Jackson）在他的著作《PayPal 大战》（The PayPal Wars）中声称，是列夫钦先下手为强，他在向蒂尔寻求支持之前，向萨克斯和其他人打探了消息。

That its origins are so unclear highlights how many of the key figures within the company Musk had managed to alienate in his brief time in charge. That so many were involved shows how concerned over the future of the company they had become.  

它的起源如此不明朗，凸显了马斯克在短暂的掌权期间疏远了公司内部多少关键人物。如此多的人参与其中，说明他们对公司的未来有多么担忧。

Whatever its origins, in early September 2000, a plot to overthrow Musk began to coalesce. The core group of plotters included Thiel, Levchin, Sacks, and, critically, both Botha and Hoffman. In a dark twist, they realized that their best chance of success was to follow the same strategy that Musk himself had used against Harris. They quietly canvassed the ex-Confinity developers and staff thought to be loyal to Levchin, as well as any X staff known to feel that Musk’s grand plan was about to bring the company down. Those staffers were then asked to sign a letter of mass resignation.  

无论其起源如何，2000 年 9 月初，一个推翻马斯克的阴谋开始凝聚。密谋的核心人物包括蒂尔、莱夫钦、萨克斯，以及至关重要的哈和霍夫曼。阴差阳错地，他们意识到成功的最佳机会就是采用马斯克自己用来对付哈里斯的策略。他们悄悄拉拢了被认为忠于列夫琴的前康菲尼迪开发人员和员工，以及任何认为马斯克的宏伟计划会拖垮公司的 X 员工。然后，这些员工被要求签署一份集体辞职信。

The issue, the plotters knew, would be winning a vote against Musk on the board. Thiel and Levchin had votes, but so did Musk, so success was entirely dependent on their ability to convince the others to vote with Thiel and Levchin, not Musk. John Malloy, a Confinity backer pre-merger, was known to be sympathetic, and he was warned about the plot. While he didn’t offer his explicit support, he didn’t alert Musk either, leading the plotters to believe he would vote their way.  

密谋者知道，问题的关键在于赢得董事会中反对马斯克的一票。Thiel 和 Levchin 有投票权，但马斯克也有投票权，所以成功与否完全取决于他们能否说服其他人投 Thiel 和 Levchin 的票，而不是投马斯克的票。众所周知，Confinity 合并前的支持者约翰-马洛伊（John Malloy）是个有同情心的人，他被警告过这个阴谋。虽然他没有明确表示支持，但也没有提醒马斯克，导致密谋者相信他会投他们一票。

This made Mike Moritz the critical board member. If Moritz sided with Musk, Hurd would, too, and that might convince Malloy to vote that way as well. Moritz had to be convinced to vote their way, and he had to be convinced while Musk, with whom Moritz had a positive relationship, wasn’t around to spin the problems the company was facing. Ideally Musk needed to be kept away from the other board members as well.  

这样，迈克-莫里茨（Mike Moritz）就成了关键的董事会成员。如果莫里茨站在马斯克一边，赫德也会站在马斯克一边，这可能会说服马洛伊也投他们一票。必须说服莫里茨投他们的票，而且必须在莫里茨与马斯克关系良好的情况下说服他，因为马斯克不在他身边，他无法解释公司面临的问题。理想情况下，马斯克也必须远离其他董事会成员。

The plotters realized there was only one day on which their coup would work: September 19. On that day, Musk was due to embark on his delayed honeymoon with his new wife, Justine Wilson. They would be flying to Sydney, Australia to watch the Olympics. In the days before accessible in-air wi-fi, calls, and messaging, the plotters would have a brief window to act in which Musk would not only be unable to find out what was happening, but also to intervene. It would also grant them precious hours to work the other board members without Musk interfering.  

密谋者们意识到，他们的政变只有一天能成功：9 月 19 日。在这一天，马斯克将与他的新婚妻子贾丝廷-威尔逊开始他推迟的蜜月旅行。他们将飞往澳大利亚悉尼观看奥运会。在空中无线网络、通话和短信尚未普及的时代，密谋者将有一个短暂的行动窗口，在这个窗口中，马斯克不仅无法发现发生了什么，而且也无法进行干预。这也为他们提供了宝贵的时间，在不受马斯克干扰的情况下与其他董事会成员周旋。

### **The fall of Musk 马斯克的陨落**

On September 19, 2000, Elon and Justine boarded a flight to Sydney. Once the plane was in the air, the coup began. Thiel and the other plotters went to Sequoia’s offices and cornered Moritz, presenting him with the issues and securing his reluctant support. Thiel then called Hurd and requested an emergency board meeting over a conference call.  

2000 年 9 月 19 日，埃隆和贾丝汀登上了飞往悉尼的航班。飞机一起飞，政变就开始了。泰尔和其他密谋者来到红杉的办公室，将莫里茨逼到墙角，向他提出了问题，并获得了他不情愿的支持。随后，蒂尔打电话给赫德，要求通过电话会议召开董事会紧急会议。

In that meeting, Levchin and Thiel laid out, in detail, all of the problems with PayPal V2, the brand changes, and the financial risks facing the firm. For Moritz, Malloy, and Hurd, arguably much of this was new information. They were not only horrified at the emerging state of the company, but also that Musk had ordered many of these decisions—such as the PayPal V2 code rewrite—without clearing it with the board. With no Musk on the call to offer a defense, the board was left to listen to the plotters’ take on the situation. Before the call ended, they were presented with the plotters’ trump card—the letter of mass resignation.   

在那次会议上，Levchin 和 Thiel 详细阐述了 PayPal V2 的所有问题、品牌变化以及公司面临的财务风险。对于莫里茨、马洛伊和赫德来说，这些可以说都是新信息。他们不仅对公司新出现的状况感到震惊，还对马斯克在没有与董事会沟通的情况下就下达了许多决定--比如 PayPal V2 代码的重写。由于马斯克没有在电话会议上为自己辩护，董事会只能听取策划者对情况的看法。电话结束前，他们收到了策划者的王牌--集体辞职信。

Meanwhile in Sydney, Musk was alerted to the ongoing coup by a loyalist. According to Jackson, they were lurking outside the conference room in which the plotters had first gathered and sent Musk an email. Now aware of what was happening back home, Musk spoke to the board by phone. None of these issues, he argued, were important or mattered. Nor, at the end of the day, did PayPal. X had always been about more than just pay-by-email, he insisted. This was all necessary to achieve his grand plan and create a global financial nexus. Musk insisted that if the board held its nerve, they could achieve so much more than simply dominating the pay-by-email market.  

与此同时，在悉尼，一名忠于马斯克的人提醒马斯克注意正在发生的政变。据杰克逊称，他们潜伏在密谋者最初聚集的会议室外，并向马斯克发送了一封电子邮件。马斯克现在知道了国内发生的事情，他通过电话与董事会进行了交谈。他认为，这些问题都不重要，也不重要。说到底，PayPal 也一样。他坚持认为，X 一直以来的目标都不仅仅是邮件支付。这一切都是实现他的宏伟计划和建立全球金融纽带所必需的。马斯克坚持认为，如果董事会能够保持冷静，他们所能实现的远不止主宰邮件付费市场这么简单。

Musk was notoriously charismatic when selling investors on his dreams, but Thiel picked the timing of the coup well. Perhaps if his appeals had been in person, Musk could have swayed Moritz and the others back to his side. The full board conducted more conference calls, with Thiel and Levchin nervously reporting progress to the other plotters by relay in the room next door. Musk himself likely soon realized that the only way to save himself at this point was to get to the others, in person, before a final decision was made. He quickly booked and boarded a flight back to the U.S.  

在向投资者推销自己的梦想时，马斯克的魅力是出了名的，但蒂尔却很好地选择了政变的时机。如果马斯克亲自出面呼吁，也许他能说服莫里茨和其他人回到自己这边。董事会全体成员进行了更多的电话会议，蒂尔和莱夫钦在隔壁房间紧张地通过中继向其他密谋者汇报进展。马斯克本人可能很快就意识到，此时此刻拯救自己的唯一办法就是在做出最终决定之前，亲自去见其他人。他迅速预订并登上了返回美国的航班。

It was too late. By the time Musk landed, the decision had already been made. He would be forced to resign, to be replaced by Thiel as interim (and soon permanent) CEO. Nor would there be a CTO role for him to fall back on this time—Levchin retained that. Musk was reduced to a directorship and a seat on the board.  

为时已晚。当马斯克抵达时，决定已经做出。他将被迫辞职，由泰尔接任临时（不久后将成为永久）首席执行官。这次，他也没有首席技术官的职位了--叶夫钦保留了这个职位。马斯克被降为董事和董事会成员。

For Musk, robbed of X as both a company and a dream, that was never going to be enough. The decision all but confirmed his departure from X soon thereafter.  

对于被剥夺了 X 公司和梦想的马斯克来说，这永远都不够。这一决定几乎确定了他不久后将离开 X 公司。

### **The deed is done 事已至此**

“Sneaky backstabbing bastards” is how Musk described the plotters in hindsight to Soni, albeit with more than a hint of sanguine humor. At the time, to Musk’s credit, he recognized that going down with a fight would only bring the company (and his investment) down with him. Thiel pivoted the company to focus entirely on PayPal, discontinue X’s financial services, and address fraud. X—or rather, PayPal, as the company was soon renamed—became a huge success. Its sale, for $1.5 billion to eBay in 2002, granted Musk as a shareholder a far larger payday than he earned for Zip2, jump-starting many of his other ventures. Musk and Thiel would work together again, with Thiel as one of SpaceX’s initial backers, and Musk has always acknowledged that, financially, PayPal’s pivot was a win.  

"阴险狡诈的混蛋"，这是马斯克事后对索尼的描述，尽管多了一丝幸灾乐祸的幽默。当时，值得称赞的是，马斯克认识到，一味地抗争只会让公司（和他的投资）跟着倒下。泰尔将公司转向完全专注于 PayPal，停止 X 的金融服务，并解决欺诈问题。X 公司--或者更确切地说，PayPal（公司很快更名为 PayPal）--取得了巨大成功。2002 年，PayPal 以 15 亿美元的价格卖给了 eBay，马斯克作为股东获得了远高于他在 Zip2 上赚取的报酬，这也启动了他的许多其他创业项目。马斯克和泰尔将再次合作，泰尔是 SpaceX 最初的支持者之一，马斯克一直承认，在财务上，PayPal 的转折是一场胜利。

Noticeably absent in any of the interviews in which Musk talks about his departure from X, however, is any acceptance that his grand plan _wouldn’t_ have worked. Lurking at the end of his sentences is always a verbal ellipsis: the suggestion that if the plotters had trusted him, the rewards would have been even greater, and they would have built a financial nexus that would now dominate the digital world.  

然而，在马斯克谈及他离开 X 公司的访谈中，明显没有人承认他的宏伟计划不会成功。潜伏在他句子末尾的总是一个省略号：暗示如果密谋者信任他，回报会更大，他们会建立一个现在主宰数字世界的金融纽带。

### **A future for Twitter 推特的未来**

Musk’s fall from power at X is what makes his pivot of Twitter so interesting. That this is a pivot, rather than the grand plan for Twitter all along, is the more likely reality. Musk’s various attempts to make Twitter profitable through changes that have aggravated users and advertisers, and resulted in thousands of sweeping job cuts, are not what you would do if your vision from the beginning is to build a one-stop-shop for anything, let alone finance. If that were the goal, then purchasing a company like SoFi rather than Twitter would have been a smarter starting point.   

马斯克在 X 公司的落马让他在 Twitter 上的转折变得如此有趣。这只是一个支点，而不是 Twitter 一直以来的宏伟计划，这才是更有可能的现实。马斯克试图通过各种变革让 Twitter 盈利，这些变革激怒了用户和广告商，并导致了数千人的全面裁员，但如果你从一开始的愿景就是建立一个一站式服务平台，你是不会这么做的，更不用说金融了。如果这是目标，那么收购 SoFi 这样的公司而不是 Twitter 会是一个更明智的起点。

All-in-one service platforms require something to persuade people to stick because they need to compete with specialist platforms offering more tailored services. WeChat achieved its dominance in part because the Chinese state desired it to be so. Musk doesn’t have that luxury. Whatever he develops will have to rely on trust to create stickiness, and on that front Musk’s own actions have left Twitter on the verge of the point of no return—potentially [breaching the trust thermocline](https://every.to/p/breaching-the-trust-thermocline-is-the-biggest-hidden-risk-in-business)—for some time, if it hasn’t already.  

一体化服务平台需要说服人们坚持使用，因为它们需要与提供更多定制服务的专业平台竞争。微信之所以能占据主导地位，部分原因是中国政府希望它如此。马斯克没有这样的奢望。在这方面，马斯克自己的行为已经让推特濒临不归路，有可能在一段时间内突破信任温度线。

Musk’s actions at Twitter are, at least in part, an attempt to rewrite the way the X and Confinity merger ended. Musk has spotted an opportunity to finally conquer the “what if” that has taunted him. This time he likely feels that there are no pesky investors that can stop him, and he is probably correct.   

马斯克在推特上的行为，至少在一定程度上，是试图改写 X 和 Confinity 合并的结局。马斯克发现了一个机会，可以最终战胜一直在嘲弄他的 "如果"。这一次，他可能觉得没有讨厌的投资者能阻止他了，而且他可能是对的。

His success this time will depend on two things: whether there is any appeal for an all-encompassing app in the West and, if so, whether there are enough people prepared to accept Musk as the force behind it, given his polarizing effect on public opinion and Twitter as a platform.  

这一次，他能否成功取决于两点：西方国家是否需要一个包罗万象的应用程序；如果需要，考虑到马斯克对舆论和 Twitter 平台的两极分化效应，是否有足够多的人愿意接受马斯克作为幕后推手。

What is clear is that Musk has begun the hunt for his great white whale once again. Whether it will succeed—or turn into a great white fail whale—remains to be seen.  

显而易见的是，马斯克又一次开始了寻找他的大白鲸之旅。它是否会成功，或者变成一头失败的大白鲸，还有待观察。
