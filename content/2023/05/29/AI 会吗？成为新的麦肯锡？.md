  original_title: Will A.I. Become the New McKinsey?
  original_lang: en-US
---

When we talk about artificial intelligence, we rely on metaphor, as we always do when dealing with something new and unfamiliar. Metaphors are, by their nature, imperfect, but we still need to choose them carefully, because bad ones can lead us astray. For example, it’s become very common to compare powerful A.I.s to genies in fairy tales. The metaphor is meant to highlight the difficulty of making powerful entities obey your commands; the computer scientist Stuart Russell has cited the parable of King Midas, who demanded that everything he touched turn into gold, to illustrate the dangers of an A.I. doing what you tell it to do instead of what you want it to do. There are multiple problems with this metaphor, but one of them is that it derives the wrong lessons from the tale to which it refers. The point of the Midas parable is that greed will destroy you, and that the pursuit of wealth will cost you everything that is truly important. If your reading of the parable is that, when you are granted a wish by the gods, you should phrase your wish very, very carefully, then you have missed the point.  
当我们谈论人工智能时，我们依赖于隐喻，就像我们在处理新的和不熟悉的事物时一样。隐喻就其本质而言是不完美的，但我们仍然需要谨慎选择它们，因为不好的隐喻会使我们误入歧途。例如，将强大的人工智能与童话故事中的精灵进行比较变得非常普遍。这个比喻是为了强调让强大的实体服从你的命令的困难；计算机科学家 Stuart Russell 引用了 King Midas 的寓言，他要求他触摸的一切都变成金子，来说明人工智能的危险。做你告诉它做的事，而不是你想让它做的事。这个比喻有很多问题，但其中之一是它从它所指的故事中得出了错误的教训。迈达斯寓言的要点是贪婪会摧毁你，追求财富会让你失去一切真正重要的东西。如果你对这个寓言的解读是，当你被神赐予一个愿望时，你应该非常非常小心地表达你的愿望，那么你就错过了重点。

So, I would like to propose another metaphor for the risks of artificial intelligence. I suggest that we think about A.I. as a management-consulting firm, along the lines of McKinsey & Company. Firms like McKinsey are hired for a wide variety of reasons, and A.I. systems are used for many reasons, too. But the similarities between [McKinsey](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1999/10/18/the-kids-in-the-conference-room)—a consulting firm that works with ninety per cent of the Fortune 100—and A.I. are also clear. Social-media companies use machine learning to keep users glued to their feeds. In a similar way, [Purdue Pharma](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/30/the-family-that-built-an-empire-of-pain) used McKinsey to figure out how to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin during the opioid epidemic. Just as A.I. promises to offer managers a cheap replacement for human workers, so McKinsey and similar firms helped normalize the practice of mass layoffs as a way of increasing stock prices and executive compensation, contributing to the destruction of the middle class in America.  
所以，我想对人工智能的风险提出另一个比喻。我建议我们考虑一下 A.I.作为一家管理咨询公司，与麦肯锡公司类似。像麦肯锡这样的公司出于各种各样的原因被聘用，而 A.I.系统的使用也有很多原因。但麦肯锡——一家与 90% 的财富 100 强企业合作的咨询公司——和人工智能之间的相似之处。也很清楚。社交媒体公司使用机器学习来让用户关注他们的信息流。以类似的方式，Purdue Pharma 利用麦肯锡研究了如何在阿片类药物流行期间“加速”OxyContin 的销售。正如 A.I.承诺为管理人员提供廉价的人力替代品，因此麦肯锡和类似公司帮助规范大规模裁员的做法，以此作为提高股价和高管薪酬的一种方式，从而导致美国中产阶级的毁灭。

A former McKinsey employee has described the company as “[capital’s willing executioners](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2019/02/mckinsey-company-capitals-willing-executioners#:~:text=An%20insider's%20perspective%20on%20how,spreads%20the%20gospel%20of%20capitalism%E2%80%A6&text=The%20author%20of%20this%20piece%20has%20chosen%20to%20maintain%20anonymity.)”: if you want something done but don’t want to get your hands dirty, McKinsey will do it for you. That escape from accountability is one of the most valuable services that management consultancies provide. Bosses have certain goals, but don’t want to be blamed for doing what’s necessary to achieve those goals; by hiring consultants, management can say that they were just following independent, expert advice. Even in its current rudimentary form, A.I. has become a way for a company to evade responsibility by saying that it’s just doing what “the algorithm” says, even though it was the company that commissioned the algorithm in the first place.  
一位前麦肯锡员工将公司描述为“资本心甘情愿的刽子手”：如果你想做某事但又不想弄脏自己的手，麦肯锡会为你做。逃避责任是管理咨询公司提供的最有价值的服务之一。老板有特定的目标，但不想因为为实现这些目标所做的必要事情而受到指责；通过聘请顾问，管理层可以说他们只是在听从独立的专家建议。即使以目前的基本形式，A.I.已经成为公司逃避责任的一种方式，说它只是在做“算法”所说的，即使首先委托该算法的是公司。

The question we should be asking is: as A.I. becomes more powerful and flexible, is there any way to keep it from being another version of McKinsey? The question is worth considering across different meanings of the term “A.I.” If you think of A.I. as a broad set of technologies being marketed to companies to help them cut their costs, the question becomes: how do we keep those technologies from working as “capital’s willing executioners”? Alternatively, if you imagine A.I. as a semi-autonomous software program that solves problems that humans ask it to solve, the question is then: how do we prevent that software from assisting corporations in ways that make people’s lives worse? Suppose you’ve built a semi-autonomous A.I. that’s entirely obedient to humans—one that repeatedly checks to make sure it hasn’t misinterpreted the instructions it has received. This is the dream of many A.I. researchers. Yet such software could easily still cause as much harm as McKinsey has.  
我们应该问的问题是：作为 A.I.变得更加强大和灵活，有什么办法不让它成为另一个版本的麦肯锡？这个问题值得考虑“A.I.”一词的不同含义。如果你想到 A.I.随着广泛的技术被推销给公司以帮助他们削减成本，问题就变成了：我们如何防止这些技术成为“资本的自愿刽子手”？或者，如果你想象 A.I.作为解决人类要求它解决的问题的半自主软件程序，问题是：我们如何防止该软件以让人们的生活变得更糟的方式帮助公司？假设你已经建立了一个半自主的人工智能。这完全服从人类——反复检查以确保它没有误解收到的指令。这是许多 A.I. 的梦想。研究人员。然而，这样的软件仍然很容易造成与麦肯锡一样多的危害。

Note that you cannot simply say that you will build A.I. that only offers pro-social solutions to the problems you ask it to solve. That’s the equivalent of saying that you can defuse the threat of McKinsey by starting a consulting firm that only offers such solutions. The reality is that Fortune 100 companies will hire McKinsey instead of your pro-social firm, because McKinsey’s solutions will increase shareholder value more than your firm’s solutions will. It will always be possible to build A.I. that pursues shareholder value above all else, and most companies will prefer to use that A.I. instead of one constrained by your principles.  
请注意，您不能简单地说您将构建 A.I.它只为你要求它解决的问题提供亲社会的解决方案。这相当于说你可以通过创办一家只提供此类解决方案的咨询公司来化解麦肯锡的威胁。事实上，财富 100 强公司将聘请麦肯锡而不是你的亲社会公司，因为麦肯锡的解决方案比你公司的解决方案更能增加股东价值。构建 A.I. 始终是可能的。追求股东价值高于一切，大多数公司更愿意使用人工智能。而不是一个受你的原则约束的人。

Is there a way for A.I. to do something other than sharpen the knife blade of capitalism? Just to be clear, when I refer to capitalism, I’m not talking about the exchange of goods or services for prices determined by a market, which is a property of many economic systems. When I refer to capitalism, I’m talking about a specific relationship between capital and labor, in which private individuals who have money are able to profit off the effort of others. So, in the context of this discussion, whenever I criticize capitalism, I’m not criticizing the idea of selling things; I’m criticizing the idea that people who have lots of money get to wield power over people who actually work. And, more specifically, I’m criticizing the ever-growing concentration of wealth among an ever-smaller number of people, which may or may not be an intrinsic property of capitalism but which absolutely characterizes capitalism as it is practiced today.  
有没有办法让 A.I.除了磨利资本主义的刀刃之外，还要做些什么？需要明确的是，当我提到资本主义时，我并不是在谈论商品或服务的价格交换，而市场决定的价格是许多经济体系的特性。当我提到资本主义时，我指的是资本与劳动之间的一种特定关系，在这种关系中，有钱的私人能够从他人的努力中获利。因此，在本次讨论的背景下，每当我批评资本主义时，我并不是在批评卖东西的想法；而是在批评卖东西的想法。我批评那些认为有很多钱的人可以对实际工作的人施加权力的想法。而且，更具体地说，我批评财富日益集中在越来越少的人手中，这可能是也可能不是资本主义的内在属性，但它绝对是当今资本主义的特征。

As it is currently deployed, A.I. often amounts to an effort to analyze a task that human beings perform and figure out a way to replace the human being. Coincidentally, this is exactly the type of problem that management wants solved. As a result, A.I. assists capital at the expense of labor. There isn’t really anything like a labor-consulting firm that furthers the interests of workers. Is it possible for A.I. to take on that role? Can A.I. do anything to assist workers instead of management?  
正如目前部署的那样，A.I.通常相当于努力分析人类执行的任务并找出替代人类的方法。巧合的是，这正是管理层想要解决的问题类型。结果，A.I.以牺牲劳动力为代价帮助资本。真的没有什么比劳工咨询公司更能促进工人利益的了。 A.I. 有可能吗？担任那个角色？ A.I. 可以吗？做任何事情来帮助工人而不是管理人员？

Some might say that it’s not the job of A.I. to oppose capitalism. That may be true, but it’s not the job of A.I. to strengthen capitalism, either. Yet that is what it currently does. If we cannot come up with ways for A.I. to reduce the concentration of wealth, then I’d say it’s hard to argue that A.I. is a neutral technology, let alone a beneficial one.  
有人可能会说这不是人工智能的工作。反对资本主义。这可能是真的，但这不是人工智能的工作。要么加强资本主义。然而，这就是它目前所做的。如果我们不能为 A.I. 想出办法。降低财富的集中度，那么我会说很难说 A.I.是一种中性技术，更不用说有益技术了。

Many people think that A.I. will create more unemployment, and bring up [universal basic income](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/who-really-stands-to-win-from-universal-basic-income), or U.B.I., as a solution to that problem. In general, I like the idea of universal basic income; however, over time, I’ve become skeptical about the way that people who work in A.I. suggest U.B.I. as a response to A.I.-driven unemployment. It would be different if we already had universal basic income, but we don’t, so expressing support for it seems like a way for the people developing A.I. to pass the buck to the government. In effect, they are intensifying the problems that capitalism creates with the expectation that, when those problems become bad enough, the government will have no choice but to step in. As a strategy for making the world a better place, this seems dubious.  
许多人认为 A.I.将造成更多的失业，并提出全民基本收入或 UBI 作为解决该问题的方法。总的来说，我喜欢全民基本收入的想法；然而，随着时间的推移，我开始怀疑从事人工智能工作的人的方式。建议 UBI作为对人工智能驱动的失业的回应。如果我们已经有了普遍的基本收入，情况会有所不同，但我们没有，所以表达对它的支持似乎是人们开发人工智能的一种方式。把责任推给政府。实际上，他们正在加剧资本主义造成的问题，并期望当这些问题变得足够严重时，政府别无选择，只能介入。作为让世界变得更美好的战略，这似乎值得怀疑。

You may remember that, in the run-up to the 2016 election, the actress Susan Sarandon—who was a fervent supporter of Bernie Sanders—said that voting for [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) would be better than voting for Hillary Clinton because it would bring about the revolution more quickly. I don’t know how deeply Sarandon had thought this through, but the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek said the same thing, and I’m pretty sure he had given a lot of thought to the matter. He argued that Trump’s election would be such a shock to the system that it would bring about change.  
你可能还记得，在 2016 年大选前夕，伯尼·桑德斯 (Bernie Sanders) 的狂热支持者女演员苏珊·萨兰登 (Susan Sarandon) 表示，投票给唐纳德·特朗普比投票给希拉里·克林顿更好，因为这会带来革命更快速。我不知道萨兰登对此想得有多深，但斯洛文尼亚哲学家斯拉沃热·齐泽克也说过同样的话，我敢肯定他对这件事考虑得很深。他争辩说，特朗普的当选将对体制产生巨大冲击，从而带来变革。

What Žižek advocated for is an example of an idea in political philosophy known as accelerationism. There are a lot of different versions of accelerationism, but the common thread uniting left-wing accelerationists is the notion that the only way to make things better is to make things worse. Accelerationism says that it’s futile to try to oppose or reform capitalism; instead, we have to exacerbate capitalism’s worst tendencies until the entire system breaks down. The only way to move beyond capitalism is to stomp on the gas pedal of neoliberalism until the engine explodes.  
齐泽克提倡的是政治哲学中被称为加速主义的思想的一个例子。加速主义有很多不同的版本，但左翼加速主义者的共同点是认为让事情变得更好的唯一方法就是让事情变得更糟。加速主义说试图反对或改革资本主义是徒劳的；相反，我们必须加剧资本主义最坏的趋势，直到整个系统崩溃。超越资本主义的唯一方法是踩下新自由主义的油门，直到引擎爆炸。

I suppose this is one way to bring about a better world, but, if it’s the approach that the A.I. industry is adopting, I want to make sure everyone is clear about what they’re working toward. By building A.I. to do jobs previously performed by people, A.I. researchers are increasing the concentration of wealth to such extreme levels that the only way to avoid societal collapse is for the government to step in. Intentionally or not, this is very similar to voting for Trump with the goal of bringing about a better world. And the rise of Trump illustrates the risks of pursuing accelerationism as a strategy: things can get very bad, and stay very bad for a long time, before they get better. In fact, you have no idea of how long it will take for things to get better; all you can be sure of is that there will be significant pain and suffering in the short and medium term.  
我想这是创造一个更美好世界的一种方式，但是，如果这是 A.I.行业正在采用，我想确保每个人都清楚他们正在努力的方向。通过构建 A.I.做以前由人做的工作，A.I.研究人员正在将财富集中度提高到如此极端的水平，以至于避免社会崩溃的唯一方法是政府介入。无论有意还是无意，这与投票给特朗普以实现更美好世界的目标非常相似。特朗普的崛起说明了将加速主义作为一种战略的风险：事情可能会变得非常糟糕，而且在好转之前会持续很长时间。事实上，您不知道事情要花多长时间才能好起来；你所能确定的是，在短期和中期会有巨大的痛苦和磨难。

I’m [not very convinced](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/why-computers-wont-make-themselves-smarter) by claims that A.I. poses [a danger to humanity](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/23/doomsday-invention-artificial-intelligence-nick-bostrom) because it might develop goals of its own and prevent us from turning it off. However, I do think that A.I. is dangerous inasmuch as it increases the power of capitalism. The doomsday scenario is not a manufacturing A.I. transforming the entire planet into paper clips, [as one famous thought experiment has imagined](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-unexpected-philosophical-depths-of-the-clicker-game-universal-paperclips). It’s A.I.-supercharged corporations destroying the environment and the working class in their pursuit of shareholder value. Capitalism is the machine that will do whatever it takes to prevent us from turning it off, and the most successful weapon in its arsenal has been its campaign to prevent us from considering any alternatives.  
我不太相信 A.I. 的说法。对人类构成威胁，因为它可能会制定自己的目标并阻止我们将其关闭。但是，我确实认为 A.I.是危险的，因为它增加了资本主义的力量。世界末日不是制造人工智能。正如一个著名的思想实验所想象的那样，将整个星球变成回形针。这是人工智能驱动的公司在追求股东价值的过程中破坏环境和工人阶级。资本主义是一台会不惜一切代价阻止我们关闭它的机器，而它最成功的武器就是它阻止我们考虑任何替代方案的运动。

People who criticize new technologies are sometimes called Luddites, but it’s helpful to clarify what the Luddites actually wanted. The main thing they were protesting was the fact that their wages were falling at the same time that factory owners’ profits were increasing, along with food prices. They were also protesting unsafe working conditions, the use of child labor, and the sale of shoddy goods that discredited the entire textile industry. The Luddites did not indiscriminately destroy machines; if a machine’s owner paid his workers well, they left it alone. The Luddites were not anti-technology; what they wanted was economic justice. They destroyed machinery as a way to get factory owners’ attention. The fact that the word “Luddite” is now used as an insult, a way of calling someone irrational and ignorant, is a result of a smear campaign by the forces of capital.  
批评新技术的人有时被称为 Luddites，但澄清 Luddites 真正想要的东西是有帮助的。他们主要抗议的是，他们的工资在下降，而与此同时，工厂主的利润却在增加，食品价格也在上涨。他们还抗议不安全的工作条件、使用童工以及销售劣质商品，这些都损害了整个纺织业的信誉。勒德分子并没有不分青红皂白地摧毁机器；如果一台机器的主人给工人高薪，他们就不会管它了。勒德分子并不反对技术；他们想要的是经济正义。他们毁坏机器以引起工厂主的注意。现在，“勒德分子”一词被用作侮辱，一种非理性和无知的称呼，是资本势力抹黑的结果。

Whenever anyone accuses anyone else of being a Luddite, it’s worth asking, is the person being accused actually against technology? Or are they in favor of economic justice? And is the person making the accusation actually in favor of improving people’s lives? Or are they just trying to increase the private accumulation of capital?  
每当有人指责其他人是勒德分子时，值得一问的是，被指控的人是否真的反对技术？还是他们赞成经济正义？提出指控的人是否真的支持改善人们的生活？或者他们只是想增加私人资本积累？

Today, we find ourselves in a situation in which technology has become conflated with capitalism, which has in turn become conflated with the very notion of progress. If you try to criticize capitalism, you are accused of opposing both technology and progress. But what does progress even mean, if it doesn’t include better lives for people who work? What is the point of greater efficiency, if the money being saved isn’t going anywhere except into shareholders’ bank accounts? We should all strive to be Luddites, because we should all be more concerned with economic justice than with increasing the private accumulation of capital. We need to be able to criticize harmful uses of technology—and those include uses that benefit shareholders over workers—without being described as opponents of technology.  
今天，我们发现自己处于这样一种情况，技术已经与资本主义混为一谈，而资本主义又与进步的概念本身混为一谈。如果你试图批评资本主义，你就会被指责既反对技术又反对进步。但是，如果进步不包括让工作的人过上更好的生活，那么进步又意味着什么呢？如果省下的钱除了存入股东的银行账户外别无他用，提高效率的意义何在？我们都应该努力成为勒德分子，因为我们都应该更关心经济正义，而不是增加私人资本积累。我们需要能够批评技术的有害使用——包括那些使股东受益而不是工人的使用——而不被描述为技术的反对者。

Imagine an idealized future, a hundred years from now, in which no one is forced to work at any job they dislike, and everyone can spend their time on whatever they find most personally fulfilling. Obviously it’s hard to see how we’d get there from here. But now consider two possible scenarios for the next few decades. In one, management and the forces of capital are even more powerful than they are now. In the other, labor is more powerful than it is now. Which one of these seems more likely to get us closer to that idealized future? And, as it’s currently deployed, which one is A.I. pushing us toward?  
想象一个理想化的未来，一百年后，没有人被迫从事任何他们不喜欢的工作，每个人都可以把时间花在他们觉得最有成就感的事情上。显然很难看出我们如何从这里到达那里。但现在考虑未来几十年的两种可能情况。其一，管理层和资本的力量比现在更强大。另一方面，劳动力比现在更强大。其中哪一个似乎更有可能让我们更接近理想化的未来？而且，正如目前部署的那样，哪一个是 A.I.把我们推向？

Of course, there is the argument that new technology improves our standard of living in the long term, which makes up for the unemployment that it creates in the short term. This argument carried weight for much of the post-Industrial Revolution period, but it has lost its force in the past half century. In the United States, per-capita G.D.P. has almost doubled since 1980, while the median household income has lagged far behind. That period covers the information-technology revolution. This means that the economic value created by the personal computer and the Internet has mostly served to increase the wealth of the top one per cent of the top one per cent, instead of raising the standard of living for U.S. citizens as a whole.  
当然，有人认为新技术可以提高我们的长期生活水平，从而弥补它在短期内造成的失业。这一论点在后工业革命时期的大部分时间里都很重要，但在过去的半个世纪里已经失去了它的影响力。在美国，人均 G.D.P.自 1980 年以来几乎翻了一番，而家庭收入中位数却远远落后。那个时期涵盖了信息技术革命。这意味着个人电脑和互联网创造的经济价值主要用于增加 1% 最富人中 1% 富人的财富，而不是提高整个美国公民的生活水平。

Of course, we all have the Internet now, and the Internet is amazing. But real-estate prices, college tuition, and health-care costs have all risen faster than inflation. In 1980, it was common to support a family on a single income; now it’s rare. So, how much progress have we really made in the past forty years? Sure, shopping online is fast and easy, and streaming movies at home is cool, but I think a lot of people would willingly trade those conveniences for the ability to own their own homes, send their kids to college without running up lifelong debt, and go to the hospital without falling into bankruptcy. It’s not technology’s fault that the median income hasn’t kept pace with per-capita G.D.P.; it’s mostly the fault of Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman. But some responsibility also falls on the management policies of C.E.O.s like [Jack Welch](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/07/was-jack-welch-the-greatest-ceo-of-his-day-or-the-worst), who ran General Electric between 1981 and 2001, as well as on consulting firms like McKinsey. I’m not blaming the personal computer for the rise in wealth inequality—I’m just saying that the claim that better technology will necessarily improve people’s standard of living is no longer credible.  
当然，我们现在都有互联网，而且互联网很棒。但房地产价格、大学学费和医疗保健费用的上涨速度都快于通货膨胀。 1980年代，靠一份收入养家糊口很普遍；现在很少见了。那么，过去四十年，我们究竟取得了多少进步呢？当然，网上购物既快捷又方便，在家看电影也很酷，但我认为很多人会愿意用这些便利来换取拥有自己的房子、送孩子上大学而不背负终生债务的能力，以及不破产就去医院。收入中位数没有跟上人均 GDP 的步伐并不是技术的错；这主要是罗纳德里根和米尔顿弗里德曼的错。但一些责任也落在了 CEO 的管理政策上，例如 1981 年至 2001 年间掌管通用电气的杰克韦尔奇，以及麦肯锡等咨询公司。我并不是将财富不平等的加剧归咎于个人电脑——我只是说，更好的技术必然会提高人们生活水平的说法不再可信。

The fact that personal computers didn’t raise the median income is particularly relevant when thinking about the possible benefits of A.I. It’s often suggested that researchers should focus on ways that A.I. can increase individual workers’ productivity rather than replace them; this is referred to as the augmentation path, as opposed to the automation path. That’s a worthy goal, but, by itself, it won’t improve people’s economic fortunes. The productivity software that ran on personal computers was a perfect example of augmentation rather than automation: word-processing programs replaced typewriters rather than typists, and spreadsheet programs replaced paper spreadsheets rather than accountants. But the increased personal productivity brought about by the personal computer wasn’t matched by an increased standard of living.  
在考虑人工智能可能带来的好处时，个人电脑并没有提高收入中位数这一事实尤为重要。通常建议研究人员应该关注 A.I. 的方式。可以提高个体工人的生产力而不是取代他们；这被称为增强路径，而不是自动化路径。这是一个有价值的目标，但就其本身而言，它不会改善人们的经济命运。在个人电脑上运行的生产力软件是增强而非自动化的完美例子：文字处理程序取代了打字机而不是打字员，电子表格程序取代了纸质电子表格而不是会计师。但是个人电脑带来的个人生产力的提高并没有伴随着生活水平的提高。

The only way that technology can boost the standard of living is if there are economic policies in place to distribute the benefits of technology appropriately. We haven’t had those policies for the past forty years, and, unless we get them, there is no reason to think that forthcoming advances in A.I. will raise the median income, even if we’re able to devise ways for it to augment individual workers. A.I. will certainly reduce labor costs and increase profits for corporations, but that is entirely different from improving our standard of living.  
技术可以提高生活水平的唯一方法是制定适当的经济政策来适当分配技术的好处。在过去的四十年里，我们没有制定过这些政策，除非我们制定了这些政策，否则没有理由认为人工智能即将取得的进步。将提高收入中位数，即使我们能够设计出增加个体工人的方法。人工智能肯定会降低劳动力成本，增加企业利润，但这与提高我们的生活水平是完全不同的。

It would be convenient if we could assume that a utopian future is right around the corner and develop technology for use in that future. But the fact that a given technology would be helpful in a utopia does not imply that it’s helpful now. In a utopia where there’s a machine that converts toxic waste into food, generating toxic waste wouldn’t be a problem, but, in the here and now, no one could claim that generating toxic waste is harmless. Accelerationists might argue that generating more toxic waste will motivate the invention of a waste-to-food converter, but how convincing is that? We evaluate the environmental impact of technologies in the context of the mitigations that are currently available, not in the context of hypothetical future mitigations. By the same token, we can’t evaluate A.I. by imagining how helpful it will be in a world with U.B.I.; we have to evaluate it in light of the existing imbalance between capital and labor, and, in that context, A.I. is a threat because of the way it assists capital.  
如果我们可以假设乌托邦式的未来就在眼前并开发用于该未来的技术，那将很方便。但是，某项技术在乌托邦中有用的事实并不意味着它现在有用。在一个拥有将有毒废物转化为食物的机器的乌托邦中，产生有毒废物不会成为问题，但是，在此时此地，没有人可以声称产生有毒废物是无害的。加速论者可能会争辩说，产生更多有毒废物会激发废物变食品转换器的发明，但这有多大说服力？我们在当前可用的缓解措施的背景下评估技术对环境的影响，而不是在假设的未来缓解措施的背景下。出于同样的原因，我们无法评估 A.I.通过想象它在拥有 U.B.I. 的世界中会有多大帮助；我们必须根据资本和劳动力之间现有的不平衡来评估它，在这种情况下，A.I.是一种威胁，因为它协助资本的方式。

A former partner at McKinsey defended the company’s actions by saying, “We don’t do policy. We do execution.” But this is a pretty thin excuse; harmful policy decisions are more likely to be made when consulting firms—or new technologies—offer ways to implement them. The version of A.I. that’s currently being developed makes it easier for companies to lay people off. So is there any way to develop a kind of A.I. that makes it harder?  
麦肯锡的一位前合伙人为公司的行为辩护说：“我们不制定政策。我们执行死刑。”但这是一个很薄弱的借口；当咨询公司或新技术提供实施方法时，更有可能做出有害的政策决定。 A.I.的版本目前正在开发的技术使公司更容易裁员。那么有什么方法可以开发一种 A.I.这让事情变得更难了？

In his book “[How to Be an Anticapitalist in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/How-Be-Anticapitalist-Twenty-First-Century/dp/1788736052),” the sociologist Erik Olin Wright offers a taxonomy of strategies for responding to the harms of capitalism. Two of the strategies he mentions are smashing capitalism and dismantling capitalism, which probably fall outside the scope of this discussion. The ones that are more relevant here are taming capitalism and resisting capitalism. Roughly speaking, taming capitalism means government regulation, and resisting capitalism means grassroots activism and labor unions. Are there ways for A.I. to strengthen those things? Is there a way for A.I. to empower labor unions or worker-owned coöperatives?  
社会学家埃里克·奥林·赖特 (Erik Olin Wright) 在他的《如何成为 21 世纪的反资本主义者》一书中提供了应对资本主义危害的策略分类。他提到的两个策略是粉碎资本主义和拆除资本主义，这可能不在本次讨论的范围之内。这里更相关的是驯服资本主义和抵制资本主义。粗略地说，驯服资本主义就是政府监管，反抗资本主义就是草根行动主义和工会。有没有办法让 A.I.强化那些东西？有没有办法让 A.I.赋予工会或工人拥有的合作社权力？

In 1976, the workers at the Lucas Aerospace Corporation in Birmingham, England, were facing layoffs because of cuts in defense spending. In response, the shop stewards produced a document known as the Lucas Plan, which described a hundred and fifty “socially useful products,” ranging from dialysis machines to wind turbines and hybrid engines for cars, that the workforce could build with its existing skills and equipment rather than being laid off. The management at Lucas Aerospace rejected the proposal, but it remains a notable modern example of workers trying to steer capitalism in a more human direction. Surely something similar must be possible with modern computing technology.  
1976 年，英国伯明翰卢卡斯航空航天公司的员工因国防开支削减而面临裁员。作为回应，车间管家制定了一份名为卢卡斯计划的文件，其中描述了 150 种“对社会有用的产品”，从透析机到风力涡轮机和汽车混合动力发动机，劳动力可以利用其现有技能和设备而不是被解雇。卢卡斯航空航天公司的管理层拒绝了该提议，但它仍然是工人试图将资本主义引向更人性化方向的一个著名现代例子。现代计算技术肯定可以实现类似的事情。

Does capitalism have to be as harmful as it currently is? Maybe not. The three decades following the Second World War are sometimes known as the golden age of capitalism. This period was partially the result of better government policies, but the government didn’t create the golden age on its own: corporate culture was different during this era. In General Electric’s annual report from 1953, the company bragged about how much it paid in taxes and how much it was spending on payroll. It explicitly said that “maximizing employment security is a prime company goal.” The founder of Johnson & Johnson said that the company’s responsibility to its employees was higher than its responsibility to its shareholders. Corporations then had a radically different conception of their role in society compared with corporations today.  
资本主义必须像现在这样有害吗？也许不会。第二次世界大战后的三十年有时被称为资本主义的黄金时代。这一时期部分是政府政策更好的结果，但政府并没有自己创造黄金时代：这个时代的企业文化不同。在通用电气 1953 年的年度报告中，该公司吹嘘自己缴纳了多少税款，以及在工资单上花费了多少。它明确表示“最大限度地提高就业保障是公司的首要目标。”强生创始人表示，公司对员工的责任高于对股东的责任。与今天的公司相比，当时的公司对其在社会中的作用有着截然不同的概念。

Is there a way to get back to those values? It seems unlikely, but remember that the golden age of capitalism came after the enormous wealth inequality of the Gilded Age. Right now we’re living in a second Gilded Age, in which wealth inequality is about the same as it was back in 1913, so it’s not impossible that we could go from where we are now to a second golden age. Of course, in between the first Gilded Age and the golden age we had the Great Depression and two World Wars. An accelerationist might say that those events were necessary to bring about the golden age, but I think most of us would prefer to skip over those steps. The task before us is to imagine ways for technology to move us toward a golden age without bringing about another Great Depression first.  
有没有办法回到这些价值观？这似乎不太可能，但请记住，资本主义的黄金时代是在镀金时代巨大的财富不平等之后到来的。现在我们生活在第二个镀金时代，其中财富不平等与 1913 年大致相同，因此我们从现在的状态进入第二个黄金时代并非不可能。当然，在第一个镀金时代和黄金时代之间，我们经历了大萧条和两次世界大战。加速论者可能会说这些事件对于黄金时代的到来是必要的，但我认为我们大多数人更愿意跳过这些步骤。摆在我们面前的任务是想象技术如何将我们推向黄金时代，而不会首先带来另一场大萧条。

We all live in a capitalist system, so we are all participants in capitalism whether we like it or not. And it’s reasonable to wonder if there’s anything you as an individual can do. If you work as a food scientist at Frito-Lay and your job is to invent new flavors of potato chip, I’m not going to say that you have an ethical obligation to quit because you’re assisting the engine of consumerism. You’re using your training as a food scientist to provide customers with a pleasant experience; that’s a perfectly reasonable way to make a living.  
我们都生活在资本主义制度中，所以不管我们喜不喜欢，我们都是资本主义的参与者。并且有理由怀疑您作为个人是否可以做任何事情。如果你在 Frito-Lay 担任食品科学家，你的工作是发明新口味的薯片，我不会说你有道德义务辞职，因为你正在协助消费主义的引擎。您正在利用您作为食品科学家的培训为客户提供愉快的体验；这是一种非常合理的谋生方式。

But many of the people who work in A.I. regard it as more important than inventing new flavors of potato chip. They say it’s a world-changing technology. If that’s the case, then they have a duty to find ways for A.I. to make the world better without first making it worse. Can A.I. ameliorate the inequities of our world other than by pushing us to the brink of societal collapse? If A.I. is as powerful a tool as its proponents claim, they should be able to find other uses for it besides intensifying the ruthlessness of capital.  
但是许多从事 A.I. 工作的人。把它看得比发明新口味的薯片还重要。他们说这是一项改变世界的技术。如果真是这样，那么他们就有责任为 A.I. 寻找方法。让世界变得更美好，而不是先让它变得更糟。 A.I. 可以吗？除了将我们推向社会崩溃的边缘之外，还能改善我们世界的不平等吗？如果 A.I.就像它的支持者声称的那样强大的工具，除了加强资本的无情之外，他们应该能够找到它的其他用途。

If there is any lesson that we should take from stories about genies granting wishes, it’s that the desire to get something without effort is the real problem. Think about the story of “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” in which the apprentice casts a spell to make broomsticks carry water but is unable to make them stop. The lesson of that story is not that magic is impossible to control: at the end of the story, the sorcerer comes back and immediately fixes the mess the apprentice made. The lesson is that you can’t get out of doing the hard work. The apprentice wanted to avoid his chores, and looking for a shortcut was what got him into trouble.  
如果我们应该从有关精灵实现愿望的故事中吸取任何教训，那就是不费吹灰之力就能得到某些东西的愿望才是真正的问题。想想“魔法师的学徒”的故事，学徒施了一个咒语让扫帚提水，但无法让它们停下来。这个故事的教训并不是魔法无法控制：在故事的结尾，巫师回来并立即修复学徒造成的混乱。教训是你无法摆脱艰苦的工作。徒弟想逃避他的杂务，想找捷径反而惹上了麻烦。

The tendency to think of A.I. as a magical problem solver is indicative of a desire to avoid the hard work that building a better world requires. That hard work will involve things like addressing wealth inequality and taming capitalism. For technologists, the hardest work of all—the task that they most want to avoid—will be questioning the assumption that more technology is always better, and the belief that they can continue with business as usual and everything will simply work itself out. No one enjoys thinking about their complicity in the injustices of the world, but it is imperative that the people who are building world-shaking technologies engage in this kind of critical self-examination. It’s their willingness to look unflinchingly at their own role in the system that will determine whether A.I. leads to a better world or a worse one. ♦  
倾向于认为 A.I.作为一个神奇的问题解决者表示希望避免建设更美好世界所需的艰苦工作。这项艰苦的工作将涉及解决财富不平等和驯服资本主义等问题。对于技术人员来说，最艰巨的工作——他们最想避免的任务——将质疑技术越多越好的假设，以及他们可以继续照常营业、一切都会自行解决的信念。没有人喜欢思考他们在世界的不公正中的同谋，但构建震撼世界的技术的人们必须进行这种批判性的自我反省。他们是否愿意坚定地审视自己在系统中的角色，这将决定 A.I.导致一个更好的世界或一个更坏的世界。 ♦
