Everyone’s tax returns [are open for inspection in Norway](https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2016/apr/11/when-it-comes-to-tax-transparency-norway-leads-the-field). This means you can see the income and financial history of colleagues, lovers, frenemies, enemies, and in-laws. But there’s a catch: Everyone can also see exactly who’s looked at their tax returns.  

在挪威，每个人的纳税申报表都可以公开查阅。这意味着您可以查看同事、恋人、死敌、敌人和姻亲的收入和财务历史。但有一个问题：每个人都可以看到谁看过自己的纳税申报单。

It’s a classic example of decision theory, the mathematics field that looks at the most rational decisions for individuals, when weighing risk and benefit.  

这是决策理论的一个典型例子。决策理论是一个数学领域，研究个人在权衡风险和收益时做出的最理性的决定。

David Just, a behavioral economist at Cornell University, explains that it’s possible to write the decision to look at another person’s tax returns as an equation. That equation would demonstrate estimated risk, and the probability of that risk occurring (largely dependent on how close you are to the person whose finances you’re eyeing).  

康奈尔大学的行为经济学家大卫-贾斯特（David Just）解释说，可以将查看他人纳税申报单的决定写成一个等式。这个等式将显示出估计的风险，以及风险发生的概率（主要取决于你与你正在关注其财务状况的人的关系有多近）。

It’s the second set of information—the knowledge that your peeking will be seen—that makes the decision especially interesting. “I can see that playing a big role in keeping this from being a situation where everybody checks up on how what everybody else is making,” Just says.  

正是第二组信息--知道你的偷窥会被看到--让这个决定变得特别有趣。"贾斯特说："我可以看到，这在避免出现每个人都检查别人在做什么的情况方面发挥了重要作用。

Indeed Ricardo Perez-Truglia, assistant professor of economics at UCLA, has researched how Norway’s open tax return policy affects behavior. It used to be possible to browse anonymously, he says, but this changed in 2014.  

事实上，加州大学洛杉矶分校经济学助理教授里卡多-佩雷斯-特鲁利亚（Ricardo Perez-Truglia）曾研究过挪威的公开报税政策如何影响人们的行为。他说，以前可以匿名浏览，但这种情况在2014年发生了变化。

“The number of people using the website to search for others’ income went down like crazy. There were still lots of people going to the website but what they wanted to know wasn’t the income of others, but whether others were searching for their own income.”  

"使用网站搜索他人收入的人数疯狂下降。还是有很多人去网站，但他们想知道的不是别人的收入，而是别人是否在搜索自己的收入。"

Perez-Truglia agrees that the closer two people are, the higher both the potential cost and benefit of looking at the other’s tax return. You won’t care much about the income of someone you don’t know, for example, but you might well care about your arch-enemy at work. Of course, there’s very little risk when it comes to checking out the tax return’s of high-profile figures, including politicians, as your name will be lost among the thousands. Indeed, newspapers publish lists of the income and taxes paid by politicians, which would likely come as a shock to Donald Trump, who is [refusing to release](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/09/15/donald-trump-has-two-new-reasons-for-refusing-publicly-disclose-tax-returns/eqH8rjuKKmoEgSAChglvaK/story.html) his tax returns.  

佩雷斯-特鲁利亚也认为，两个人关系越亲密，查看对方纳税申报单的潜在成本和收益就越高。例如，你不会太关心一个不认识的人的收入，但你很可能会关心你工作中的宿敌。当然，查看包括政客在内的高知名度人物的纳税申报单风险很小，因为你的名字会被淹没在成千上万的申报单中。事实上，报纸会公布政客的收入和纳税清单，这可能会让拒绝公布纳税申报单的唐纳德-特朗普大吃一惊。

The social cost of looking at another person’s tax return is also likely to be impacted by the culture of how many choose to look. Perez-Truglia reasons that if looking at tax returns becomes increasingly common, more people are likely to jump on the band wagon. “If I see a bunch of people are doing the searches then I think ‘Oh well, if they’re searching, it must be because the social norm is different online,’ ” he says.  

查看他人纳税申报单的社会成本还可能受到选择查看的文化的影响。佩雷斯-特鲁利亚认为，如果查看纳税申报单变得越来越普遍，那么可能会有更多的人加入这一行列。"他说："如果我看到很多人都在搜索，那么我就会想'哦，好吧，如果他们在搜索，那一定是因为网上的社会规范不同了'。

Perez-Truglia has found that Norway’s decision to make tax returns transparent has had a vast impact, leading to [a significant increase in the gap](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2657808) in well-being between the richest and the poorest Norwegians. People are now acutely aware of their income relative to others, and know that everybody else knows their own status. This seems to make the wealthy happier, and the poor less happy.  

佩雷斯-特鲁格利亚发现，挪威将纳税申报透明化的决定产生了巨大影响，导致最富有和最贫穷的挪威人之间的福利差距显著扩大。人们现在清楚地知道自己相对于他人的收入，也知道其他人都知道自己的状况。这似乎使富人更快乐，穷人更不快乐。

He’s also begun researching whether having public tax returns changes spending habits. “One reason why people buy really expensive boots and clothing and things like that is because they want to show off, they want to signal that they’re rich. But in Norway, when the public knows who’s rich and who’s not, what’s the point of buying these types of goods?” he asks.  

他还开始研究公开纳税申报是否会改变消费习惯。他说："人们购买昂贵的靴子和衣服等物品的原因之一是，他们想炫耀，想表明自己很富有。但在挪威，当公众都知道谁有钱、谁没钱时，买这些商品还有什么意义呢？

Perez-Truglia says he hasn’t yet evaluated the data that tests this theory. But, regardless of whether his hypothesis holds true, Norway’s public tax returns certainly shatter a taboo. So, would you look?  

佩雷斯-特鲁利亚说，他还没有对检验这一理论的数据进行评估。但是，无论他的假设是否成立，挪威的公开纳税申报单无疑打破了一个禁忌。那么，您会看吗？
