When I was a computer science student in college, everyone I knew read Slashdot. Founded in 1997, the site was dedicated to "News for nerds. Stuff that matters." It featured about a dozen short, user-submitted stories about the technology news of the day. In most cases, the stories consisted of a short summary and a link to content elsewhere on the Web.  

当我在大学里是一名计算机科学学生时，我认识的每个人都读Slashdot。该网站成立于1997年，致力于为 "书呆子提供新闻。重要的东西"。它有大约一打简短的、由用户提交的关于当天技术新闻的故事。在大多数情况下，这些故事包括一个简短的摘要和一个指向网络上其他地方的内容的链接。

The site was created by Rob Malda, who was then an undergraduate at Hope College, a liberal arts college in Michigan. Malda ran Slashdot [until 2011.](http://meta.slashdot.org/story/11/08/25/1245200/rob-cmdrtaco-malda-resigns-from-slashdot) Then, after taking a year off, he [joined WaPo Labs](http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/03/05/202206/rob-malda-cmdrtaco-joins-the-washington-post), a technology incubator owned by the Washington Post Company, the parent company of the _Washington Post_. (WaPo Labs is not among the companies [being purchased by Jeff Bezos.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/jeff-bezos-on-post-purchase/2013/08/05/e5b293de-fe0d-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)) I spoke to Malda last week. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.  

该网站由Rob Malda创建，他当时是密歇根州文理学院希望学院的一名本科生。马尔达经营Slashdot到2011年。然后，在休息了一年之后，他加入了WaPo实验室，这是一个由华盛顿邮报公司（华盛顿邮报的母公司）拥有的技术孵化器。(WaPo Labs不在杰夫-贝佐斯收购的公司之列。)我上周采访了马尔达。下面的文字记录已经过编辑，以保证长度和清晰度。

**Timothy B. Lee: For readers who aren't familiar with Slashdot, how did it get started?  

蒂莫西-B-李：对于那些不熟悉Slashdot的读者，它是如何开始的？**

Rob Malda: Slashdot started in 1997. It grew out of my personal blogging, but you didn't call it blogging in 1997 because blogging didn't exist then. I was writing about sci-fi movies and tech issues. I was an active open source developer, though it wasn't called open source back then. I was contributing to different packages. And Slashdot really grew out of mailing lists and IRC channels that I was participating in. I would find things I liked and I would write about them. Over a few years, I wrote a content-management system, and it turned into something a little bigger.  

Rob Malda：Slashdot始于1997年。它是从我的个人博客中发展起来的，但在1997年你不叫它博客，因为那时博客还不存在。我当时写的是科幻电影和技术问题。我是一个活跃的开放源码开发者，虽然那时还不叫开放源码。我在为不同的软件包做贡献。Slashdot是在我参与的邮件列表和IRC频道中发展起来的。我发现我喜欢的东西，我就会写它们。几年后，我写了一个内容管理系统，然后它变成了一个更大的东西。

My earliest audience primarily came from the fact that I was an open source developer. I was participating in mailing lists. My personal Web site had thousands of readers because they were downloading software I had written. I was really active in X11 window managers \[which provide the user interface on Linux\]. I had screenshots of desktops, and I was making graphics and icons. I was an art as well as computer science student. My stuff looked interesting. I didn't intentionally pull people from IRC and mailing lists. I think they were already there.  

我最早的听众主要来自于我是一个开放源代码的开发者。我当时参加了邮件列表。我的个人网站有成千上万的读者，因为他们在下载我写的软件。我在X11窗口管理器\[在Linux上提供用户界面\]方面非常活跃。我有桌面的截图，而且我在制作图形和图标。我是一个艺术和计算机科学的学生。我的东西看起来很有趣。我并没有故意从IRC和邮件列表中拉人。我认为他们已经在那里了。

**So you didn't build a community from scratch. Rather, Slashdot grew out of your existing relationships in the open source world?  

所以你并没有从头开始建立一个社区。相反，Slashdot是从你在开源世界的现有关系中发展起来的？**

That's the thing. People ask me why were you successful. The thing I tell them is no bulls\*\*t. I never had to fake what I was doing because this is just what I was doing. These are the people I was hanging out with. These are things I was doing for fun. I was completely embedded inside of it, because it was my hobby. It was what I did for fun. I don't understand how reporters for a newspaper can say "now you're in charge of France." That doesn't click with me. I would be terrible at \[reporting on\] France. I don't know anything about it. The tech stuff was mine. I lived it.  

这就是问题所在。人们问我，你为什么会成功。我告诉他们的是不要胡说八道。我从来不需要假装我在做什么，因为这就是我在做的事情。这些是和我一起玩的人。这些都是我为了好玩而做的事情。我完全融入其中，因为这是我的爱好。这是我做的事情的乐趣。我不明白报纸的记者怎么会说 "现在你负责法国了"。这对我来说并不合适。我在\[报道\]法国方面会很糟糕。我对它一无所知。技术方面的东西是我的。我住在那里。

**Was there a moment when you thought to yourself, 'this Slashdot thing just might take off'?  

是否有那么一刻，你对自己说："Slashdot这个东西可能会起飞"？**

My joke answer is I still wasn't sure about it up until about five  years ago. There was a moment, and I don't think this was the moment that I realized that it was financially viable, but there was a moment that I had realized it was something that had grown well beyond my control.  

我的笑话是，直到大约五年前，我仍然不确定它。有一个时刻，我不认为这是我意识到它在财务上可行的时刻，但有一个时刻，我已经意识到这是一个已经远远超出我控制的东西。

One night we were sitting in my living room, myself and several other Slashdot folks. And we were tailing apache logs and we were doing DNS lookups on the IPs \[e.g. monitoring who was visiting Slashdot.\] And we said "Oh my God, someone from Microsoft is reading." "Oh my God, someone from Stanford is reading." "Oh my God, here's someone in France." As fast as I'm doing DNS lookups, people are coming from every continent. We had a really active user from the South Pole for a time. That was a really jaw-on-the-ground moment. We thought we were just a bunch of people screwing around. It's one thing to have tens of thousands of visitors. It's another thing to realize they're _everywhere._  

一天晚上，我们坐在我的客厅里，我和其他几个Slashdot的人。我们跟踪apache日志，并对IP进行DNS查询\[例如，监测谁在访问Slashdot\]，然后我们说："哦，我的上帝，微软的人在阅读。"哦，我的上帝，斯坦福大学的人正在阅读。""哦，我的上帝，这里有一个人在法国。"就像我在做DNS查询一样快，人们从各大洲赶来。有一段时间，我们有一个来自南极的非常活跃的用户。那是一个非常令人瞠目结舌的时刻。我们以为我们只是一群人在胡闹。有数以万计的访客是一回事。意识到他们无处不在又是另一回事。

**Slashdot was one of the first sites that had to deal with large-scale user-submitted comments. What did you learn about how to build a healthy online community?  

Slashdot是第一批必须处理大规模用户提交的评论的网站之一。你在如何建立一个健康的网络社区方面学到了什么？**

I did not premeditate anything. I just winged it, and when I saw problems I triaged them. The Slashdot system was very much evolved and not designed.  

我没有预谋什么。我只是随心所欲，当我看到问题时，我就把它们分流。Slashdot系统在很大程度上是进化出来的，而不是设计出来的。

One thing I learned is don't spend your entire life playing predictive defense against attacks that will never happen. Real people are very clever. If they choose to attack you they'll attack you in ways you can't predict.  

我学到的一件事是，不要把你的一生都花在对永远不会发生的攻击进行预测性防御上。真正的人是非常聪明的。如果他们选择攻击你，他们会以你无法预测的方式攻击你。

People get bored fairly quickly, but the rare person never gets bored ever, and you have to be very careful of that person because they might be your best user or they might be a terrible person. And if you give them too much control they could do bad things.  

人们很快就会感到厌烦，但极少数人永远不会感到厌烦，你必须非常小心这个人，因为他们可能是你最好的用户，也可能是一个糟糕的人。如果你给他们太多的控制权，他们可能会做坏事。

Most people are just purely passive consumers, and that's okay. I think a lot of people in this space obsess too much over trying to convert passives into actives. Some people are just wired to be that kind of person. Others aren't. That's okay.  

大多数人只是纯粹的被动消费者，这没有问题。我认为这个领域的很多人过于执着于试图将被动者转化为主动者。有些人天生就是这样的人。其他人则不是。这也没关系。

**Are there new aggregators that have taken the place Slashdot once occupied?  

是否有新的聚合器取代了Slashdot曾经占据的位置？**

Hacker News is awesome. It is probably my number one RSS feed right now. But it's getting too big. They've crossed the line that reddit crossed a long time ago. The value on reddit now is on the subreddits, not on the main page. Hacker News is wobbling on that space now. If I could just find someone who made a Hacker News digest, with the 10 best items from Hacker News, that would be a really good Slashdot.  

黑客新闻》非常棒。它可能是我现在的头号RSS提要。但它变得太大。他们已经越过了reddit很久以前越过的界限。现在reddit的价值在子reddits上，而不是在主页面上。Hacker News现在在这个空间上摇摇欲坠。如果我能找到一个做黑客新闻摘要的人，把黑客新闻中最好的10个项目放在一起，那将是一个真正好的Slashdot。

**Did Slashdot cross that line?  

Slashdot是否越过了那条线？**

I'm the wrong person to ask that. I was too in the middle of it to look at it objectively. I tend to look at Slashdot not so much from the mix of stories that were on the site from one day to the next and rather with the big milestones in the site and how I felt about the site during that era. And for me, the sun set somewhere between the OMG Ponies April Fools Day \[April 1, 2006, when the Slashdot theme color was changed to pink and the "news for nerds" slogan" was changed to "OMG!!! Ponies!!!"\] and the 10-year anniversary \[in October 2007\].  

我是问这个问题的错误人选。我当时身处其中，无法客观地看待它。我倾向于看Slashdot，而不是从网站上一天到一天的故事组合来看，而是从网站的重大里程碑以及我在那个时代对网站的感受来看。对我来说，太阳是在OMG小马的愚人节\[2006年4月1日，Slashdot的主题颜色被改为粉红色，"书呆子的新闻 "口号被改为 "OMG!小马！！！"\]和10周年纪念日\[2007年10月\]之间。

**What changes about an aggregation site to make it lose its early greatness?  

一个聚合网站发生了什么变化，使它失去了早期的伟大之处？**

To me, it's really about volume. \[When starting a site\] your first task is to just get a critical mass of content. When you have a really small group of people, that's really tough. But the small group has shared themes, shared interests. The output is really interesting. Slashdot in the early days was very focused on small subject matters--not particularly diverse. As the community gets bigger, there's a natural dilution of that original audience, but the amount of content increases, so then it's less an issue of acquiring information and more about editing it.  

对我来说，这实际上是关于数量的问题。\[当开始一个网站时，你的首要任务是获得足够数量的内容。当你有一个非常小的群体时，这真的很困难。但这个小团体有共同的主题，共同的兴趣。其产出真的很有趣。Slashdot在早期非常专注于小的主题事项--不是特别多样化。随着社区越来越大，原有的受众自然会被稀释，但内容的数量也会增加，所以这就不是一个获取信息的问题，而是一个编辑信息的问题。

This is why Hacker News would be better if I could get the 10 best items. I don't care about a new version of CoffeeScript, but when tech culture stuff happens, the right story is there and it's fast. But I have to click through a lot of stories that aren't relevant to me.  

这就是为什么Hacker News会更好，如果我可以得到10个最佳项目。我并不关心CoffeeScript的新版本，但当科技文化的事情发生时，正确的故事就在那里，而且速度很快。但我不得不点击浏览大量与我无关的故事。

With Slashdot, I was able to control that to a certain extent because the home page was rate-limited to humans making the call about what goes on that page. reddit can have 200 items on the home page. Slashdot we kept bounded to 10 or 15 \[posts per day in the early years\] and by the end we kept it bounded by 20 or 25. At some point that 31st story isn't really that much better. With more and more voices, you tend toward broader subjects. Eventually it becomes less and less interesting.  

在Slashdot，我能够在一定程度上控制这个问题，因为主页上的内容是由人类来决定的，是有速度限制的。Slashdot我们将其限制在10或15个\[早期每天的帖子\]，到最后我们将其限制在20或25个。在某些时候，第31个故事并没有真正好到哪里去。随着声音越来越多，你倾向于更广泛的主题。最终，它变得越来越无趣。

But what's interesting to \[me\] isn't always the thing that's most lucrative. I had a pretty strong belief that the population of Slashdot users was relatively fixed. That makes for a crappy business model. You want to have a million really good users and be done? How does make the chart go up and to the right?  

但对\[我\]来说，有趣的东西并不总是最有利可图的东西。我有一个非常强烈的信念，即Slashdot的用户群是相对固定的。这使得一个蹩脚的商业模式。你想拥有一百万个真正优秀的用户就可以了吗？如何使图表向上和向右走？

**Do you see any sites that have the potential to be the next Hacker News?  

你认为有什么网站有可能成为下一个黑客新闻吗？**

I don't think it's going to work that way any more. I think that the power has decentralized. Successful people on Twitter basically can fulfill a lot of that same role. You can follow Tim O'Reilly and Robert Scoble and Tim Lee and you can get a pretty good summary of what's happening around the universe.  

我不认为它会以这种方式运作。我认为，权力已经分散了。Twitter上的成功人士基本上可以履行很多相同的角色。你可以关注Tim O'Reilly、Robert Scoble和Tim Lee，你可以得到一个相当好的关于宇宙中发生的事情的总结。

But I think Twitter is fundamentally broken in certain regards. You get a lot of mediocre stuff along with that. Everyone thinks they're interesting. Part of the value of Slashdot was I could rate-limit it down to a few things a day, and still leave you with a sense you have pretty good sense of what was happening during the day. But if you follow 50 people, that is an epic time commitment.  

但我认为Twitter在某些方面是根本性的破坏。你会得到很多平庸的东西，与此同时。每个人都认为自己很有趣。Slashdot的部分价值在于，我可以把它的速度限制在每天几条，并且仍然让你感觉到你对当天发生的事情有相当好的认识。但是，如果你关注50个人，这就是一个史诗般的时间承诺。

So I'm not sure that there is a clear heir apparent. There's power in what reddit does, and what Hacker News does and to a lesser extent what sites like Slashdot still do. But the power has shifted to individuals. My concern is still that the tools aren't really there yet to make that as good of an experience. I don't feel like I get as good an experience out of Twitter as I got out of a good mailing list and an IRC chat room and Slashdot 15 years ago. It's different, chattier, I get more pictures of what people ate. It doesn't necessarily bring people insight.  

所以我不确定是否有一个明确的继承人。reddit所做的事有力量，Hacker News所做的事也有力量，在较小的程度上，像Slashdot这样的网站仍然在做。但是权力已经转移到了个人身上。我担心的是，现在还没有真正的工具来使其成为一种好的体验。我不觉得我从Twitter得到的体验有15年前从一个好的邮件列表、IRC聊天室和Slashdot得到的体验那么好。它是不同的，更多的是聊天，我得到了更多人们吃东西的照片。它不一定能带给人们洞察力。

**What tech-related topics are you most obsessed with right now?  

你现在最迷恋的是什么科技相关的话题？**

Bitcoin. Not a lot has been happening on Bitcoin lately.  

比特币。最近在比特币上发生的事情不多。

\[I'm interested in Bradley\] Manning. I'm not interested in the verdict part. That was the aftermath. The interesting part already happened. The WikiLeaks thing, the giant cache of documents. All of that happened. \[The verdict is\] just cleanup.  

\[我对布拉德利\]曼宁感兴趣。我不感兴趣在判决的一部分。这是后话。有趣的部分已经发生。维基解密的事情，巨大的文件缓存。所有这一切都发生了。\[判决是\]只是清理。

I guess what matters to me in the Manning case is: will that influence the next person? Because we have [\[Edward\] Snowden](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-cancels-upcoming-meeting-with-putin/2013/08/07/0e04f686-ff64-11e2-9711-3708310f6f4d_story.html?hpid=z1&itid=lk_inline_manual_52) who did a vaguely similar thing. It remains to be seen what charges he'll ever face. If your only option for leaking government secrets--what did Manning get, 5 counts or something, and Snowden can never come back to the country again--that sets the bounds of what the punishment is for leaking.  

我想在曼宁案中，对我来说重要的是：这是否会影响到下一个人？因为我们有\[爱德华\]斯诺登谁做了一个模糊的类似的事情。他将面临什么指控，还有待观察。如果你泄露政府机密的唯一选择--曼宁得到了什么，5项罪名或什么，而斯诺登永远不能再回到这个国家--那就设定了对泄密的惩罚界限。

The stuff that's interesting has as much to do with the technology as the information. I'm interested in the technology the government uses to spy on me. I'm interested in the fact of the anonymous file-sharing network that made the Manning stuff possible. That's the stuff that gets to my soft, gooey center. The policy parts, I don't feel like I have a say in that. I don't have a voice there. I know what I want to see happen. But I don't feel like I have a say or a voice so I choose to be interested in the technology and think about where that's going to take us next. All that stuff never would have existed 20 years ago.  

有趣的东西与技术和信息一样多。我对政府用来监视我的技术感兴趣。我对匿名文件共享网络的事实感兴趣，它使曼宁的事情成为可能。这是东西，得到了我的软，粘稠的中心。政策部分，我不觉得我有一个发言权。我在那里没有发言权。我知道我想看到什么发生。但我不觉得我有发言权，也没有发言权，所以我选择对技术感兴趣，并思考下一步会把我们带到哪里。所有这些东西在20年前是不会存在的。

**A lot of people who are interested in computers and the Internet—the kind of people who read Slashdot—have a pretty strong civil libertarian bent. Any idea why that is?  

很多对计算机和互联网感兴趣的人--阅读Slashdot的那种人--都有相当强烈的公民自由主义倾向。知道这是为什么吗？**

I don't know that it's interested in computers specifically. There's a whole slew of overlapping factors. College-educated folks tend to have backgrounds in computers, so they tend to be slightly left-leaning.  

我不知道它是否对计算机特别感兴趣。有一连串的重叠因素。受过大学教育的人往往有计算机方面的背景，所以他们倾向于稍微左倾。

A lot of the Slashdot readers came out of the open source/free software movement. There's this core kernel of folks, that "information wants to be free" nucleus of the free software movement. They are naturally fearful of authority. It comes out of this natural sense that Microsoft can't be trusted because their closed binaries control our destiny. It's easy to see someone who's fearful of Microsoft would be fearful of the government.  

很多Slashdot的读者都是从开源/自由软件运动中走出来的。在自由软件运动中，有这样一个核心人物，即 "信息想要自由 "的核心人物。他们自然而然地惧怕权威。这来自于这种自然的感觉，即微软不能被信任，因为他们封闭的二进制文件控制着我们的命运。很容易看到一个对微软感到恐惧的人也会对政府感到恐惧。

There was a lot of libertarian leaning in Slashdot, more so than the global population. I think a big piece of it is that the hacker ethos, the hacker spirit is the natural desire to tinker, take apart and take control. Anything that hampers that becomes the enemy. Which is why \[geeks care about\] copyrights and patents, that kind of stuff. "What do you mean I can't take apart my car engine? That's insane."  

在Slashdot有很多自由主义倾向的人，比全球人口更多。我认为其中一个重要原因是，黑客的精神，黑客的精神是修补、拆解和控制的自然欲望。任何阻碍这一点的东西都会成为敌人。这就是为什么\[极客们关心\]版权和专利，诸如此类的东西。"你说我不能拆开我的汽车引擎是什么意思？这真是疯了。"

"What I can't reverse-engineer my CPU? I can't decompile a binary?" That runs against the grain of these people. That means you have to start taking steps backwards. That leads you to corporations and governments. That leads you to naturally distrust everyone.  

"什么我不能对我的CPU进行逆向工程？我不能反编译一个二进制文件？"这与这些人的想法相悖。这意味着你必须开始采取倒退措施。这导致你去找公司和政府。这导致你自然地不信任所有人。

**How did you come to the _Washington Post_ and what are you working on here?  

你是如何来到《华盛顿邮报》的，你在这里从事什么工作？**

Somebody posted my resume to Hacker News and I spent the following month doing about 50-odd interviews with 40-odd companies. It was really cool because I got to see what a lot of interesting startups were into and talked to some big companies that I'd been writing about for a long, long time.  

有人把我的简历贴到了Hacker News上，然后我花了一个月的时间，对40多家公司进行了大约50次采访。这真的很酷，因为我看到了很多有趣的初创公司的情况，并与一些我已经写了很久很久的大公司交谈。

But the Post had a number of things that I was very interested in being able to play with. The Labs team that I work for is a small group of engineers that has relative autonomy in the company, relative to the newspaper. We're not owned by the newspaper, we're owned by the parent company. Our charter is different. Our charter is interesting: take a big swing at the future of news. To that end, we have built interesting technology. The people here are all interested in the same things I am, which is the future of news and using interesting technologies and communities to address that problem. I found that a lot of the ideas being explored here are similar enough to the ideas I had that I'd be able to fit in nicely and not have to go hire 20 engineers of my own to go build something.  

但是，邮报有很多东西是我非常想玩的。我所在的实验室团队是一个由工程师组成的小团体，相对于报社来说，在公司里有相对的自主权。我们不属于报纸，我们属于母公司。我们的章程是不同的。我们的章程很有趣：在新闻的未来大干一场。为此，我们建立了有趣的技术。这里的人都对我感兴趣，也就是新闻的未来和使用有趣的技术和社区来解决这个问题。我发现，这里正在探索的很多想法与我的想法足够相似，我能够很好地融入其中，而不必自己去雇用20名工程师去建立什么。

My current project is a redesign of social reader. The original version of it was conceived as a Facebook app that stood on top of a fairly popular tech stack that we'd been building for a few years. Over the previous year, Facebook throttled the "frictionless sharing" feature that they had rolled out that the Social Reader platform was originally designed for. I'm currently working on re-conceiving the product to have its own soft of natural community and not be wholly dependent on the existence of Facebook to drive it.  

我目前的项目是重新设计社交阅读器。它的原始版本被设想为一个Facebook应用程序，它站在一个相当流行的技术栈之上，我们已经建立了几年。在过去的一年里，Facebook扼杀了他们推出的 "无摩擦分享 "功能，而社交阅读平台最初就是为该功能设计的。我目前正在努力重新构想该产品，使其拥有自己的软性自然社区，而不是完全依赖Facebook的存在来驱动它。

If you want to have a social news product, you need to be involved in every step of the loop, the aggregation of content, the curation of content, the sharing. You need to be involved in every step and originally Facebook was the primary controller of sharing, which meant we were powerless to control our own fate.  

如果你想拥有一个社会新闻产品，你需要参与每一个环节，内容的聚合，内容的策划，分享。你需要参与每一个步骤，最初Facebook是分享的主要控制者，这意味着我们无力控制自己的命运。
