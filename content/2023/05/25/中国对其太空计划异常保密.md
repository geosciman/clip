## What is it doing up there?  
它在上面做什么？

May 18th 2023 | BEIJING 2023 年 5 月 18 日 |北京

Nine months after being secretly launched into orbit, an uncrewed Chinese spacecraft touched down at a spaceport in the Gobi desert on May 8th. Not much is known about the mission. A terse report from state media called it an “important breakthrough”.

在秘密发射进入轨道 9 个月后，一艘无人驾驶的中国航天器于 5 月 8 日降落在戈壁沙漠的一个航天港。对这次任务知之甚少。官方媒体的一份简短报道称这是一个“重要突破”。

The Chinese spacecraft may be similar to one developed by the US air force, called the X\-37B, which has spent over 900 days in space in one stretch. Both were launched by rockets, but can land like a normal plane. Reusing spacecraft saves money. Such vessels can also help conduct scientific experiments or release satellites. While in orbit, China’s spacecraft discharged a small object.

中国的航天器可能类似于美国空军研制的X-37b，一口气在太空呆了900多天。两者都是由火箭发射的，但可以像普通飞机一样降落。重复使用航天器可以节省资金。此类船只还可以帮助进行科学实验或发射卫星。在轨道上，中国航天器发射了一个小物体。

The secrecy surrounding the mission is partly understandable. Many governments are coy about their space activities—especially ones with potential military purposes. America has limited the release of information surrounding the X\-37B. But China is more secretive than most when it comes to space.

围绕任务的保密性在一定程度上是可以理解的。许多政府对他们的太空活动含糊其辞——尤其是那些具有潜在军事目的的活动。美国限制了有关 x-37b 的信息发布。但在太空方面，中国比大多数国家都更加隐秘。

Take the country’s Tiangong space station, which has an ostensibly scientific purpose. Since its completion in October, China hasn’t been very forthcoming about its astronauts’ activities there. When two of them went for a spacewalk on March 30th, it was announced after the fact. No details were given. The International Space Station, by contrast, flags all spacewalks in advance, then live-streams them.

以表面上具有科学目的的国家天宫空间站为例。自去年 10 月完工以来，中国对其宇航员在那里的活动一直不太坦诚。当他们两人在 3 月 30 日进行太空行走时，事后宣布了这一消息。没有给出细节。相比之下，国际空间站会提前标记所有太空行走，然后进行直播。

Given the prestige at stake, officials may be inclined to hide failures. In 2021 China landed a rover called Zhurong on Mars. In May of last year it went into a planned hibernation for the Martian winter, when there is less sunlight to power it. Zhurong should have woken up in December. It was not until April that Chinese scientists explained that a build-up of dust had stopped the sun’s rays from restarting the rover.

鉴于声望受到威胁，官员们可能倾向于隐瞒失败。 2021 年，中国在火星上登陆了名为“祝融”的火星车。去年 5 月，它进入了计划中的休眠状态，以迎接火星的冬季，届时为其提供动力的阳光较少。祝融应该在十二月醒来。直到 4 月，中国科学家才解释说，灰尘的堆积阻止了太阳光线重新启动火星车。

Sometimes China’s secrecy is more alarming. The modules that make up the Tiangong were brought into orbit by a series of rockets. Pieces of these rockets then fell back to Earth. While much of the debris burned up on re-entry, some hit the Earth’s surface. No one was hurt. But America’s space agency, NASA, complained that China did not share data about the falling material to help other countries assess the risks.

有时中国的保密更令人担忧。组成天宫的模块由一系列火箭送入轨道。这些火箭的碎片随后落回地球。虽然大部分碎片在重返大气层时燃烧殆尽，但仍有一些碎片撞击了地球表面。全员平安无事。但美国航天局美国国家航空航天局抱怨说，中国没有分享坠落物质的数据，以帮助其他国家评估风险。

Part of the problem is that the People’s Liberation Army runs China’s spaceports and its crewed space missions. So it is difficult to distinguish between China’s civilian space activities and its military ones. (Space technologies themselves are often dual-use.) China’s rivals tend to assume the worst. In January the head of NASA, Bill Nelson, warned that China might start claiming lunar territory “under the guise of scientific research”.

部分问题在于，中国人民解放军负责管理中国的航天港和载人航天任务。因此很难区分中国的民用太空活动和军用太空活动。 （太空技术本身通常具有双重用途。）中国的竞争对手往往会做最坏的打算。 1 月，美国国家航空航天局局长比尔尼尔森警告说，中国可能会“打着科学研究的幌子”开始宣称拥有月球领土。

Around the same time, the European Space Agency said it would not be sending astronauts to the Tiangong, as previously planned. That is probably a result of tensions back on Earth. Has the notion of decoupling extended to space, too?■

大约在同一时间，欧洲航天局表示不会按原计划将宇航员送往天宫号。这可能是地球上紧张局势的结果。去耦的概念是否也延伸到了太空？■
