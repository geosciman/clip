"...the mere consciousness of an engagement will sometimes worry a whole day."  

"......光是意识到有婚约，有时就会担心一整天。"

– Charles Dickens

One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.

  

程序员如此不喜欢会议的一个原因是，他们的时间安排与其他人不同。会议让他们花费更多。

There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's schedule is for bosses. It's embodied in the traditional appointment book, with each day cut into one hour intervals. You can block off several hours for a single task if you need to, but by default you change what you're doing every hour.

  

有两种类型的时间表，我称之为经理的时间表和制造者的时间表。经理的日程表是为老板准备的。它体现在传统的约会簿上，每天的时间间隔为一小时。如果你需要的话，你可以为一项任务留出几个小时的时间，但默认情况下，你每小时都会改变你的工作内容。

When you use time that way, it's merely a practical problem to meet with someone. Find an open slot in your schedule, book them, and you're done.

  

当你这样使用时间时，与人见面只不过是一个实际问题。在你的日程安排中找到一个空档，预订他们，你就完成了。

Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command. But there's another way of using time that's common among people who make things, like programmers and writers. They generally prefer to use time in units of half a day at least. You can't write or program well in units of an hour. That's barely enough time to get started.

  

大多数有权势的人都在经理的时间表上。这是命令的时间表。但还有一种使用时间的方式，在制造东西的人中很常见，比如程序员和作家。他们一般喜欢以至少半天为单位使用时间。你不可能以一小时为单位进行写作或编程。那是勉强足够的时间来开始工作。

When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting. That's no problem for someone on the manager's schedule. There's always something coming on the next hour; the only question is what. But when someone on the maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to think about it.

  

当你按照制造者的时间表运作时，会议是一场灾难。一个会议就可以毁掉整个下午，因为它被分成两部分，每部分都太小，无法做任何困难的事情。此外，你还得记住去开会。这对经理的日程表上的人来说不是问题。下一个小时总有事情发生；唯一的问题是什么。但是，当制造者的日程表上的人有一个会议时，他们必须要考虑这个问题。

For someone on the maker's schedule, having a meeting is like throwing an exception. It doesn't merely cause you to switch from one task to another; it changes the mode in which you work.

  

对于一个在制造者日程表上的人来说，开个会就像抛出一个例外。它不仅仅是让你从一个任务转到另一个任务；它还改变了你的工作模式。

I find one meeting can sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking up a morning or afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a cascading effect. If I know the afternoon is going to be broken up, I'm slightly less likely to start something ambitious in the morning. I know this may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker, think of your own case. Don't your spirits rise at the thought of having an entire day free to work, with no appointments at all? Well, that means your spirits are correspondingly depressed when you don't. And ambitious projects are by definition close to the limits of your capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough to kill them off.

  

我发现一个会议有时会影响一整天。一个会议通常会破坏至少半天的时间，因为它打破了一个上午或下午。但除此之外，有时还会产生连带效应。如果我知道下午会被打乱，我就不太可能在早上开始做一些雄心勃勃的事情。我知道这听起来可能过于敏感，但如果你是一个制作人，想想你自己的情况。一想到有一整天的时间可以自由工作，没有任何约会，你的精神难道不振奋吗？那么，这意味着当你不工作时，你的精神也会相应地消沉。而雄心勃勃的项目，顾名思义就是接近你能力的极限了。士气的小幅下降就足以扼杀它们。

Each type of schedule works fine by itself. Problems arise when they meet. Since most powerful people operate on the manager's schedule, they're in a position to make everyone resonate at their frequency if they want to. But the smarter ones restrain themselves, if they know that some of the people working for them need long chunks of time to work in.

  

每种类型的时间表本身运作良好。当它们相遇时，问题就出现了。由于大多数有权势的人都按经理的时间表运作，如果他们想的话，他们有能力让每个人在他们的频率上产生共鸣。但更聪明的人克制自己，如果他们知道一些为他们工作的人需要长块的时间来工作。

Our case is an unusual one. Nearly all investors, including all VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule. But [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) runs on the maker's schedule. Rtm and Trevor and I do because we always have, and Jessica does too, mostly, because she's gotten into sync with us.

  

我们的案例是一个不寻常的案例。几乎所有的投资者，包括我所知道的所有风险投资公司，都是按照经理人的时间表运作。但Y Combinator是按制造者的时间表运作的。Rtm、Trevor和我是这样做的，因为我们一直都是这样做的，Jessica也是这样做的，主要是因为她已经和我们同步了。

I wouldn't be surprised if there start to be more companies like us. I suspect founders may increasingly be able to resist, or at least postpone, turning into managers, just as a few decades ago they started to be able to resist switching from jeans to suits.

  

如果开始有更多像我们这样的公司，我不会感到惊讶。我怀疑创始人可能越来越能够抵制，或者至少推迟，变成经理人，就像几十年前他们开始能够抵制从牛仔裤到西装的转变一样。

How do we manage to advise so many startups on the maker's schedule? By using the classic device for simulating the manager's schedule within the maker's: office hours. Several times a week I set aside a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded. These chunks of time are at the end of my working day, and I wrote a signup program that ensures all the appointments within a given set of office hours are clustered at the end. Because they come at the end of my day these meetings are never an interruption. (Unless their working day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting presumably interrupts theirs, but since they made the appointment it must be worth it to them.) During busy periods, office hours sometimes get long enough that they compress the day, but they never interrupt it.

  

我们是如何在制造者的时间表上为这么多的初创企业提供建议的呢？通过使用模拟经理人的时间表的经典设备：办公时间。每周我都会留出一些时间来会见我们所资助的创始人。这些时间是在我工作日的最后，我写了一个注册程序，以确保在一组特定的办公时间内的所有预约都集中在最后。因为他们是在我一天的工作结束时来的，所以这些会议从来没有被打断过。(除非他们的工作日与我的工作日同时结束，否则会议大概会打断他们的工作，但既然他们预约了，那对他们来说肯定是值得的)。在繁忙时期，办公时间有时会变得足够长，以至于它们压缩了一天的时间，但它们从未中断过。

When we were working on

[our own startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html), back in the 90s, I evolved another trick for partitioning the day. I used to program from dinner till about 3 am every day, because at night no one could interrupt me. Then I'd sleep till about 11 am, and come in and work until dinner on what I called "business stuff." I never thought of it in these terms, but in effect I had two workdays each day, one on the manager's schedule and one on the maker's.  

早在90年代，当我们在为自己的创业公司工作时，我又演化出了另一个划分一天的技巧。我习惯于每天从晚餐开始编程，直到凌晨3点左右，因为在晚上没有人可以打断我。然后，我会睡到上午11点左右，然后进来工作，直到晚餐，我称之为 "业务工作"。我从来没有这样想过，但实际上我每天有两个工作日，一个是经理的时间表，一个是制作人的时间表。

When you're operating on the manager's schedule you can do something you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can have speculative meetings. You can meet someone just to get to know one another. If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why not? Maybe it will turn out you can help one another in some way.

  

当你在经理的日程表上工作时，你可以做一些你永远不想在制造者的日程表上做的事情：你可以有投机性的会议。你可以和某人见面，只是为了了解彼此。如果你的日程表上有一个空档，为什么不呢？也许会发现你们可以在某些方面互相帮助。

Business people in Silicon Valley (and the whole world, for that matter) have speculative meetings all the time. They're effectively free if you're on the manager's schedule. They're so common that there's distinctive language for proposing them: saying that you want to "grab coffee," for example.

  

硅谷的商业人士（以及整个世界的商业人士）一直有投机性的会议。如果你在经理的日程表上，他们实际上是免费的。他们是如此普遍，以至于有独特的语言来提议他们：例如，说你想 "喝咖啡"。

Speculative meetings are terribly costly if you're on the maker's schedule, though. Which puts us in something of a bind. Everyone assumes that, like other investors, we run on the manager's schedule. So they introduce us to someone they think we ought to meet, or send us an email proposing we grab coffee. At this point we have two options, neither of them good: we can meet with them, and lose half a day's work; or we can try to avoid meeting them, and probably offend them.

  

不过，如果你在制作人的日程表上，投机性会议的费用是非常高的。这就使我们陷入了某种困境。每个人都认为，像其他投资者一样，我们按经理的时间表运行。所以他们把我们介绍给他们认为我们应该见面的人，或者给我们发电子邮件，提议我们去喝咖啡。在这一点上，我们有两个选择，都不好：我们可以和他们见面，然后损失半天的工作；或者我们可以尝试避免和他们见面，并且可能会冒犯他们。

Till recently we weren't clear in our own minds about the source of the problem. We just took it for granted that we had to either blow our schedules or offend people. But now that I've realized what's going on, perhaps there's a third option: to write something explaining the two types of schedule. Maybe eventually, if the conflict between the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule starts to be more widely understood, it will become less of a problem.

  

直到最近，我们自己都不清楚问题的根源。我们只是想当然地认为，我们必须要么吹响我们的时间表，要么得罪人。但现在我已经意识到是怎么回事了，也许还有第三种选择：写些东西来解释这两种类型的时间表。也许最终，如果经理人的时间表和制造者的时间表之间的冲突开始被更广泛地理解，它将成为一个较小的问题。

Those of us on the maker's schedule are willing to compromise. We know we have to have some number of meetings. All we ask from those on the manager's schedule is that they understand the cost.

  

我们这些制定时间表的人愿意作出妥协。我们知道我们必须要有一些会议的数量。我们对那些在管理者日程表上的人所提出的要求是，他们要理解这个成本。
