**A** few months ago [I wrote about Oswald Spengler’s attempt at comparative world history](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/12/spengler-and-search-for-science-of.html). I expressed severe reservations with Spengler’s methods and conclusions.\[1\] But for me the most fascinating parts of the book were the footnotes to Spengler’s main argument. Take, for example, Spengler’s attempt to compare and contrast members of his chosen pantheon of “great” scientists, philosophers, and artists over the course of world history. This particular comparative game is just a sidenote to his larger attempt at comparative civilizational history: Spengler’s main thesis is that all great cultures (and by culture he means something as broad as the entire classical world, the modern West, or all of India) follow a parallel course of development. Events that occur in one era for one culture will have distinct mirrors in another culture a few centuries later.  Thus if one culture had its Socrates and its Homer, or it Jesus and its Justinian, then other great cultures will produce figures of similar stature that play a similar role in their own civilization’s story.  

几个月前，我写了一篇关于奥斯瓦尔德·斯宾格勒尝试进行比较世界历史的文章。我对斯宾格勒的方法和结论表示了严重的保留。但对我来说，这本书最迷人的部分是斯宾格勒对主要论点的注释。例如，斯宾格勒试图比较和对比他所选择的“伟大”科学家、哲学家和艺术家在世界历史上的表现。这种特定的比较游戏只是他在比较文明史上的更大尝试的一个附注：斯宾格勒的主要论点是所有伟大的文化（文化的范围包括整个古典世界、现代西方或整个印度）都会经历平行的发展历程。一个文化在某个时代发生的事件将在几个世纪后在另一个文化中有明显的反映。因此，如果一个文化有它的苏格拉底和荷马，或者有它的耶稣和查士丁尼，那么其他伟大的文化也会产生类似地位的人物，对他们自己文明的故事起着类似的作用。

Now the specifics of Spengler’s comparisons are not really that important for this post. If you would like to know more of those details feel free to read [my original review essay of his work](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/12/spengler-and-search-for-science-of.html). The only thing relevant to the point I want to explore here is that Spengler saw his own culture, that of the modern West, as beginning in the high Middle Ages and reaching its point of intellectual stagnation in his own lifetime. 20th century Europe was about to enter the period where politics swallows up the world of thought and creativity. Empire would lead to intellectual rigidity, just as it did in Rome two millennia before. This periodization explains the book’s contemporary popularity—everybody loves books that predict imminent disaster—but it meant that Spengler gave himself a fairly difficult task. It is easy to pick out the most significant figures of ancient history—say, Socrates or the Buddha—and pronounce that these were comparable figures of similar historical weight. That they are still household names millennia later is all the evidence you need to prove that these men were, in Spengler’s words, “world-historical” figures. But how do you pick out which of your contemporaries deserve that honor? One day a few men of your generation may be vindicated by history. But that history has not happened yet. Humility demands that we decline to declare what only time can prove.  

现在，斯宾格勒的比较细节对于本文来说并不是那么重要。如果你想了解更多细节，可以随意阅读我对他的作品的原始评论文章。我想要探讨的重点是，斯宾格勒认为他自己的文化，即现代西方文化，始于中世纪晚期，并在他自己的一生中达到了智力停滞的点。20世纪的欧洲即将进入政治吞噬思想和创造力的时期。帝国将导致智力僵化，就像两千年前的罗马一样。这种时期划分解释了这本书的当代流行性——每个人都喜欢预测即将到来的灾难的书——但这意味着斯宾格勒给自己设定了一个相当困难的任务。很容易挑出古代历史上最重要的人物——比如苏格拉底或佛陀——并宣称这些人是具有相似历史重要性的人物。他们仍然是家喻户晓的名字，这就足以证明这些人在斯宾格勒的话中是“世界历史”人物。 但是你如何挑选出你那一代人中值得获得荣誉的人呢？也许有一天，你那一代人中的一些人会被历史所证明。但是历史还没有发生。谦逊要求我们拒绝宣称只有时间才能证明的事情。

Spengler was not so humble. He repeatedly describes Tolstoy (d. 1910), Ibsen (d. 1906), Nietzsche (d. 1900), Hertz (d. 1894), Dostoevsky (d. 1881), Marx (d. 1883), and Maxwell (1879) as figures of defining “world-historical” importance: in other words, as working on the same plane as Plato, Archimedes, Ovid, Shakespeare, and Newton. He does not argue their merits; to him it is obvious that these are the men who deserve to be thought of as “world-historical” figures, and it is clear from the way he makes his arguments that he expects that his own readers already agree with him.  

斯宾格勒并不谦逊。他一再将托尔斯泰（逝于1910年）、易卜生（逝于1906年）、尼采（逝于1900年）、赫兹（逝于1894年）、陀思妥耶夫斯基（逝于1881年）、马克思（逝于1883年）和麦克斯韦尔（逝于1879年）描述为具有决定性“世界历史”重要性的人物：换句话说，他认为他们与柏拉图、阿基米德、奥维德、莎士比亚和牛顿一样在同一层面上工作。他并不争论他们的价值；对他来说，显然这些人是应该被视为“世界历史”人物的人，从他提出论点的方式可以清楚地看出，他期望他的读者已经同意他的观点。

Ponder that! Spengler began writing _Decline of the West_ in 1914. Tolstoy was only four years dead when Spengler started his book; Marx was only 30 years deceased. But Spengler could state, with the full expectation that his audience would not question him, that these men belonged in global pantheon of humanity’s greatest figures. But Spengler was hardly alone in this sort of judgement. Ten years later [John Erskine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Erskine_(educator)) would teach his course on the great works of the Western tradition—which was the granddaddy of the Columbia Common Core, the St. John’s curriculum, and the Great Books of the Western World series—and it included all of the names mentioned above as well. To this Erskine would add the names William James, Sigmund Freud, Thomas Hardy, and Charles Darwin.\[2\]  

考虑一下吧！斯宾格勒在1914年开始写《西方的衰落》。托尔斯泰去世仅四年后，斯宾格勒开始写他的书；马克思去世仅30年。但斯宾格勒可以断言，并且完全期望他的听众不会质疑他，这些人属于人类最伟大人物的全球群像。但斯宾格勒在这种判断上并不孤单。十年后，约翰·厄斯金将教授他的西方传统伟大作品课程——这是哥伦比亚大学通识核心、圣约翰学院课程和《西方世界伟大著作》系列的鼻祖——其中包括上述所有名字。厄斯金还会加入威廉·詹姆斯、西格蒙德·弗洛伊德、托马斯·哈代和查尔斯·达尔文的名字。\[2\]

Now Erskine’s list is not perfect; it has not perfectly weathered the centuries. The fame of William James has sunk with time; today we usually think of Joseph Conrad, not Thomas Hardy, as the supreme English novelist of that era. But the broader point holds: only a decade or two after these men’s deaths intellectuals confidently spoke of them in the same breath as Shakespeare and Plato. And not just subjectively, in the sense we might today (“_I_ think Urusala LeGuin is as good as Shakespeare” or “_I_ think Hayek is better than Plato”) but with full knowledge that the broader public already knew that these people and their works belonged on the list. It was obvious to even those who disliked Nietzche that he was a seminal figure in Western thought; it was obvious even to those who disagreed with Ibsen that he claimed a similar place in Western literature, and so forth. Their ideas might be argued against, but their genius and their influence was undeniable.  

厄斯金的名单并非完美；它并没有完全经受住时间的考验。威廉·詹姆斯的名声随着时间的推移而下降；今天，我们通常认为约瑟夫·康拉德，而不是托马斯·哈代，是那个时代最伟大的英国小说家。但更广泛的观点仍然成立：在这些人去世仅十年或二十年后，知识分子们自信地将他们与莎士比亚和柏拉图并列。这不仅是主观的，就像我们今天可能会说的那样（“我认为乌若拉·勒瑰恩和莎士比亚一样优秀”或“我认为哈耶克比柏拉图更好”），而是充分了解到更广泛的公众已经知道这些人和他们的作品应该被列入名单。即使那些不喜欢尼采的人也明显地知道他是西方思想的开创性人物；即使那些不同意易卜生的人也明显地知道他在西方文学中占据了类似的地位，等等。他们的观点可能会受到质疑，但他们的天才和影响力是不可否认的。

Is there anyone who died in the last decade you could make that sort of claim for?  

在过去十年中有人符合你所说的那种情况吗？

How about for the last two decades?  

在过去的二十年里呢？

The last three?  最后三个？

Or is there anyone at all who is still living today that might be described this way?  

还有人今天还活着，可以用这种方式来描述吗？

In the realm of science, perhaps. But in the world of social, historical, ethical, and political thought, no one comes to mind. Most “great books” curricula stop right around World War II and its immediate aftermath. St. John’s recently added Wittgenstein and de Beauvoir to their curricula, but their works are almost 70 years old. Michel Foucault is the next obvious candidate, and he died 37 years ago.  

在科学领域也许是这样。但在社会、历史、伦理和政治思想的世界中，没有人能够比拟。大多数“伟大著作”课程都停留在二战及其直接后果周围。圣约翰学院最近将维特根斯坦和德·博伏尔的作品加入了他们的课程，但这些作品几乎已有70年历史。米歇尔·福柯是下一个明显的候选人，他在37年前去世了。

In the world of literature there are more candidates that I can imagine people listing: Beckett, Achebe, Márquez, Morrison, Ishiguro, Solzhenitsyn all come to mind, but none save the last would be recognized as automatically, obviously deserving to be on the list, and the last only because he is one of the key testaments of the 20th century’s totalitarian experiment, and it still is not clear which individual will be seen as the definitive voice of that experiment in a few centuries time (Orwell? Arendt? Levi? Grossman? Serge?).  

文学世界中有更多的候选人，我无法想象人们会列出: 贝克特、阿切贝、马尔克斯、莫里森、石黑一雄、索尔仁尼琴都会浮现在脑海中，但除了最后一个之外，没有人会被自动、显然地认为应该在名单上，而最后一个之所以被认可，是因为他是20世纪极权实验的关键见证之一，但目前还不清楚在几个世纪后，哪个人会被视为这一实验的最终代表声音（奥威尔？ 阿伦特？ 利维？ 格罗斯曼？ 谢尔盖？）。

Where have all the great works gone?  

伟大的作品都去哪了？

In my essay “[Living in the Shadow of the Boomers](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2020/10/on-living-in-shadow-of-boomers.html)” and in [my review of Lawrence Friedman’s _Strategy: A History_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/07/book-notesstrategy-history.html) I have discussed closely related questions. The latter book is intellectual history of strategic thinking— including military strategy, political strategy, and business strategy— over the last three centuries. Because strategic theory is so thoroughly intertwined with broader intellectual currents, the book served as an able history of social, economic, and political thought over that time. Though it is not the book’s central thesis, it is clear from his survey that there was a post 1950s decline in the quality of thought in all three domains. There are many possible reasons for this: these sixty years we have lived enslaved to the culture of the boomers, a generation whose great intellectual commitments were explicitly anti-intellectual. The professionalization of intellectual pursuit is another problem. Melville would never have written _Moby Dick_ if he had spent years enrolled in an MFA program instead of spending years at sea. Men and women who in past ages would have observed humanity up close (or at least who would have been forced through a broad but rigorous education in classics) instead cloister themselves in ivory towers. Their intellectual energy is channeled into ever more specialized academic fields and cautiously climbing a bureaucratic and over-managed academic ladder. Could that social scene ever produce a great work?   

在我的文章《生活在婴儿潮一代的阴影下》和我对劳伦斯·弗里德曼的《战略：历史》的评论中，我讨论了密切相关的问题。后一本书是关于战略思维的知识史——包括军事战略、政治战略和商业战略——跨过去三个世纪。由于战略理论与更广泛的知识潮流紧密交织在一起，这本书成为了社会、经济和政治思想在那段时间的一部精彩历史。尽管这不是这本书的中心论点，但从他的调查中清楚地看出，在这三个领域的思想质量在1950年代后出现了下降。这可能有很多原因：在这六十年里，我们一直被婴儿潮文化所奴役，这一代人的伟大知识承诺明确是反智的。知识追求的职业化是另一个问题。梅尔维尔如果在海上度过多年，而不是在MFA项目中度过多年，就不会写出《白鲸》。 过去时代中那些本来会近距离观察人类的男人和女人（或者至少会被迫接受广泛而严格的古典教育），现在却把自己关在象牙塔里。他们的智力能量被引导到越来越专业的学术领域，并小心翼翼地攀登官僚化和过度管理的学术阶梯。这样的社会场景能产生伟大的作品吗？

But much of this is not entirely unique to human history. Nations go through creative phrases. Occasionally a lucky combination of massed intellectuals and useful incentives converge in one era, inspiring a series of great works remembered centuries later. Then it dissipates out. It is not strange for America to repeat this experience. More damaging, and perhaps more unique, is how American stagnation has deadened creative thought across the globe. In many ways global intellectual life has been reduced to American intellectual life. Here is how I describe it [**in my review of _Strategy_:**](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/07/book-notesstrategy-history.html)  

但其中许多并非完全独特于人类历史。国家经历创造性阶段。偶尔，大量知识分子和有益激励的幸运组合会在某个时代汇聚，激发出一系列几个世纪后仍被记住的伟大作品。然后它逐渐消散。美国重复这种经历并不奇怪。更为有害，也许更为独特的是，美国的停滞已经使全球的创造性思维变得迟钝。在许多方面，全球的知识生活已经被简化为美国的知识生活。这就是我在《战略》评论中描述的情况。

> Freedman’s history really begins only in the 19th century. Specifically, 19th century Europe. At this time, no one European country dominates the debates over military, political, or revolutionary strategy. Germany is something of the center-node for strategic thought and practice as the century comes to a close, but the Germans by no means have a monopoly on strategy, and there is no clear division between debates happening within Germany and those happening outside of it. In both military and revolutionary circles, everybody read everybody else.  
> 
> 弗里德曼的历史实际上只始于19世纪。具体来说，是19世纪的欧洲。在这个时期，没有一个欧洲国家主导军事、政治或革命战略的辩论。随着世纪的结束，德国在战略思想和实践方面成为了某种中心节点，但德国人并不是战略的垄断者，德国内部的辩论与德国外部的辩论之间没有明确的分野。在军事和革命圈子里，每个人都在阅读其他人的作品。
> 
> When American thinkers first show up on the scene in the 1910s, this did not change. They simply joined the conversation. It is clear from Freedman’s profile of American theorists like Jane Addams and John Dewey (not who you expected to show up in this book, is it?), that the American thinkers of this era viewed themselves as voices in an international conversation. Freedman presents them as such; the chapter in which they appear gives equal space to Max Weber and Leo Tolstoy.  
> 
> 当美国思想家在1910年代首次出现时，情况并未改变。他们只是加入了这场对话。从弗里德曼对简·亚当斯和约翰·杜威等美国理论家的描述中可以清楚地看出（这不是你期望在这本书中出现的人物，对吧？），这个时代的美国思想家将自己视为国际对话中的声音。弗里德曼将他们呈现为这样的形象；他们出现的章节给了麦克斯·韦伯和列夫·托尔斯泰同等的空间。
> 
> This changes in the post-war world. In each of the three eras, Freedman’s intellectual history narrows in on America after 1945. These chapters are devoted almost entirely to case studies involving American social movements, American military conflicts, or American firms. Henceforth he profiles frameworks created by strategic theorists living in America or made relevant because they were written in English and addressed to Americans. There are two main exceptions to this: a chapter on Foucault and French social theory of the 60s and 70s, and a chapter on Japanese business strategy in the 1980s. Even these two chapters earn their place mostly because of the immediate impact their subjects had on American strategic thought in ’80s and ’90s. The utility of French thinking and Japanese praxis is assessed by the impact they had on American conceptions of strategy.  
> 
> 这种情况在战后世界发生了变化。在这三个时代中，弗里德曼的思想史主要聚焦于1945年后的美国。这些章节几乎完全致力于涉及美国社会运动、美国军事冲突或美国公司的案例研究。因此，他主要介绍了由居住在美国的战略理论家创建的框架，或者因为它们是用英语撰写并面向美国人而变得相关。有两个主要的例外：一章关于福柯和60年代和70年代的法国社会理论，以及一章关于80年代的日本商业战略。即使这两章主要之所以获得位置，也是因为它们的主题对80年代和90年代美国战略思想产生了直接影响。法国思想和日本实践的实用性是通过它们对美国战略观念的影响来评估的。
> 
> There is a larger pattern here. You will find it on numerous syllabi in philosophy and related topics in the humanities. A chronologically minded 101 course will contain a scatter-shot collection of writings from the ancient and medieval world, a much larger chunk of content from 18th and 19th century Europe, and then around 1950 or so “Western” thought becomes “Anglophone” thought, and most of that is really just “American.” Freedman did not invent this pattern, but he does follow it.\[3\]  
> 
> 这里有一个更大的模式。您会在哲学和人文相关课程的许多教学大纲中找到它。一个以时间顺序为导向的101课程将包含古代和中世纪世界的一系列文献，以及18和19世纪欧洲更大量的内容，然后大约在1950年左右，“西方”思想变成了“英语国家的”思想，而其中大部分实际上只是“美国”的思想。弗里德曼并没有发明这种模式，但他确实遵循了它。\[3\]

Interestingly, Freedman is not an American himself. This narrative is not a creation of self-centered Americans but rather the standard way of thinking about many topics regardless of the country in which one lives. There are explanations for this: the best scientists, academics, and entrepreneurs from every nation flock to the United States and its university system. American pop culture saturates the music and movies of other nations. It is not uncommon to find Asians or Europeans who know more about American politics than many Americans do themselves. Their mind has been taken over by American affairs. Thus the creative classes of the rest of the entire Earth are sucked into the same orbit that the Americans have languished in for three generations. This only reinforces Americans own significant cultural insularity. While there may be important debates being had and works being written in Russian, Spanish, or Chinese, those works are not being translated for American readers.  

有趣的是，弗里德曼本人并不是美国人。这种叙事并不是自我中心的美国人的创造，而是许多话题的标准思维方式，不管一个人生活在哪个国家。这有其解释：来自各国的最优秀的科学家、学者和企业家都涌向美国及其大学体系。美国流行文化充斥着其他国家的音乐和电影。发现亚洲人或欧洲人比许多美国人更了解美国政治并不罕见。他们的思想已被美国事务所占据。因此，地球上其他地方的创意阶层被吸入了美国人已经停滞了三代人的同一轨道。这只会加强美国人自身显著的文化封闭性。虽然在俄罗斯、西班牙或中国可能正在进行重要的辩论和著作，但这些作品并没有被翻译成美国读者可以阅读的。

This is probably the greatest cost of American hegemony. In a world in which American culture is so dominant yet so sterile it is difficult for genuinely fresh developments abroad to arise. For three decades we have had our universal empire and all the intellectual rigidity that comes with it. Perhaps Spengler’s prediction that the Western world would follow the Roman may not have been wrong, just a few decades too early.  

这可能是美国霸权最大的代价。在一个美国文化如此占主导地位却又如此贫乏的世界里，国外真正新颖的发展很难出现。三十年来，我们拥有了我们的普遍帝国，以及随之而来的所有智力僵化。也许斯宾格勒对西方世界将会效仿罗马的预言并没有错，只是时间提前了几十年。
