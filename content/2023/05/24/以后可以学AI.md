Throw a dart on LinkedIn, or toss one into the ether on Twitter, and you'll likely hit a post proclaiming that you better "learn AI" or you're falling behind.  

在 LinkedIn 上扔一个飞镖，或者在 Twitter 上扔一个飞镖，你很可能会看到一个帖子，宣称你最好“学习 AI”，否则你就落后了。

Master the tools and become a prompt engineer or someone else will tell the AI to summarize the long documents, kick off initial first drafts, and rewrite the headlines for you!  

掌握这些工具并成为一名及时的工程师，否则其他人会告诉 AI 总结长篇文档，开始最初的初稿，并为您重写标题！

Nonsense.

This isn't saying AI, ChatGPT, or whatever comes next is nonsense. It's very real, very powerful, and very here.  

这并不是说 AI、ChatGPT 或接下来出现的任何东西都是无稽之谈。它非常真实，非常强大，而且就在这里。

But there's nothing you need to learn, or do, right now, other than be curious. Play around, kick the tires, poke and prod. Get a feel for what this new sauce tastes like. Have fun, it's not a test.  

但是，除了好奇之外，您现在不需要学习或做任何事情。四处玩耍，踢轮胎，戳和戳。感受一下这种新酱汁的味道。玩得开心，这不是测试。

But become a master at once or you're going to lose your job to some AI expert? Nah. That's pure FUD. The stuff that everyone's talking about is barely 6 months old — there are no experts, there are just people playing experts on the internet.  

但马上成为大师，否则你会丢掉工作给某个 AI 专家？不。那是纯粹的 FUD。每个人都在谈论的东西还不到 6 个月——没有专家，只有在互联网上扮演专家的人。

Besides, the best way to learn something is to need that something. Learning when you don't really need to is a good way to give up early. Learning when there's something you truly need to do, but can't, but could, is the right time to figure something out.  

此外，学习某些东西的最好方法就是需要那个东西。在你真的不需要的时候学习是提早放弃的好方法。学习什么时候你真正需要做，但不能，但可以，是想出办法的正确时机。

They say necessity is the mother of invention, but it's really the impetus for learning. The time will come, and you can figure it out then. If anything, it'll be easier to learn how to use AI once it settles in a bit. Currently it's a moving target.  

他们说需要是发明之母，但它确实是学习的动力。时候到了，到时候你就可以想办法了。如果有的话，一旦它稳定下来，学习如何使用 AI 就会更容易。目前它是一个移动的目标。

So wait on it. Pop the pressure. Don't feel like you're falling behind. And don't drop everything to dig in. Start curious, stay curious, know what it's capable of, and, when the necessity strikes, figure it out. Until then, ignore the demands and focus on doing what you're already good at.  

所以等等吧。消除压力。不要觉得自己落后了。并且不要放弃一切去挖掘。开始好奇，保持好奇，知道它的能力，并在必要时弄清楚。在那之前，请忽略要求并专注于做你已经擅长的事情。
