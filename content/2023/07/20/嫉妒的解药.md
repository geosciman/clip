I recently came across a passage from Krishamurti’s _Think On These Things_ that gave me pause. I rarely highlight entire paragraphs when I read, but this one was so poignant that I had to elevate it from the page and into my memory.  
我最近看到克里沙穆提的《思考这些事情》中的一段话让我停了下来。当我阅读时，我很少突出显示整个段落，但这一段是如此令人心酸，以至于我不得不将其从页面中提升到我的记忆中。

Here it is: 这里是：

> _I am envious because I want to be as beautiful as you are; I want to have the fine clothes, the elegant house, the high position that you have. Being dissatisfied with what I am, I want to be like you; but, if I understood my dissatisfaction and its cause, then I would not want to be like you or long for the things that you have.  
> 我羡慕，因为我想和你一样美丽；我想要拥有你那样的华丽的衣服、优雅的房子、崇高的地位。因为对自己不满意，所以我想成为像你一样的人；但是，如果我了解我的不满及其原因，那么我就不会想像你一样或渴望你拥有的东西。_
> 
> _In other words, if once I begin to understand what I am, then I shall never compare myself with another or be envious of anyone. Envy arises because I want to change myself and become like somebody else. But if I say, “Whatever I am,_ **_that_** _I want to understand,” then envy is gone; then there is no need of discipline, and out of the understanding of what I am comes integration._  
> 换句话说，如果我一旦开始了解自己是什么，那么我就永远不会与他人比较，也不会嫉妒任何人。嫉妒的产生是因为我想改变自己并变得像别人一样。但如果我说：“无论我是什么，我都想了解”，那么嫉妒就会消失；那么就不需要纪律了，从对我的本质的理解中就可以得到整合。

I’ve since re-read this paragraph many times, and there’s one sentence that continues to capture my attention:  
此后我多次重读这段文字，有一句话一直吸引着我的注意力：

> _Whatever I am,_ **_that_** _I want to understand._  
> 无论我是什么，我都想了解。

Today, I want to talk about what it means to know yourself, and how this results in the elimination of envy.  
今天，我想谈谈了解自己意味着什么，以及如何消除嫉妒。

I’d like to start with an observation: Some people are open about their struggles with envy, while the majority hide it. I’m calling it an observation because I can’t point to a research paper that clearly shows this asymmetry, yet my personal exploration of human nature indicates that this is likely true.  
我想从一个观察开始：有些人公开谈论自己与嫉妒的斗争，而大多数人却隐藏起来。我称其为观察，因为我无法指出一篇研究论文清楚地表明了这种不对称性，但我个人对人性的探索表明这可能是真的。

Simply put, envy is one of those complicated emotions that hasn’t had its time in the spotlight yet. Vulnerability came on center stage when Brene Brown gave a popular TED Talk on it, while depression has emerged(出现) as something that’s okay to discuss in recent years. Envy, however, hasn’t quite found that comfort zone. Revealing that you’re an envious person won’t yield much sympathy, and is often accompanied by a sense of shame that you feel this way.  
简而言之，嫉妒是一种尚未引起人们关注的复杂情绪。当布琳·布朗 (Brene Brown) 就脆弱性发表了一场颇受欢迎的 TED 演讲时，脆弱性成为了焦点，而抑郁症近年来也成为了值得讨论的话题。然而，Envy 还没有找到那个舒适区。揭露你是一个嫉妒的人不会产生太多同情，而且常常伴随着你有这种感觉的羞耻感。

But envy is one of the most pervasive problems in today’s world, especially as social media normalizes the successes of others, making you feel like you’re “underperforming” the average when in reality you’re being shown a highlight reel of outliers. You’re always comparing yourself to someone ahead of you, and the goalpost will keep moving because the algorithm ensures that it moves on your behalf. And whenever a hierarchy like this exists, the fingers of envy creep within.  
但嫉妒是当今世界最普遍的问题之一，尤其是当社交媒体将他人的成功正常化时，让你感觉自己“表现不佳”，而实际上你看到的是异常值的精彩片段。你总是将自己与前面的人进行比较，而球门柱会不断移动，因为算法确保它代表你移动。每当这样的等级制度存在时，嫉妒的手指就会蔓延进来。

All this results in a conundrum. Envy is running through everyone’s veins, yet no one feels like they could talk about it. No one wants to admit that the success of others makes them feel inadequate, and that this inadequacy dampens their sense of self-worth. Not only is it difficult to admit this to others, but it’s just as hard to admit it to oneself.  
所有这些都导致了一个难题。每个人的血管里都流淌着嫉妒，但没有人觉得自己可以谈论它。没有人愿意承认别人的成功让他们感到自己不足，而这种不足会削弱他们的自我价值感。不仅向别人承认这一点很难，向自己承认这一点也同样困难。

But that last word – _oneself_ – is where the solution to this resides.  
但最后一个词——“自己”——才是解决这个问题的方法。

Ultimately, envy is the result of not knowing who you are. It arises when you outsource your definitions of success to whatever norms you’ve adopted – whether consciously or not. In one person’s case, it might be wealth. In another, it may be social media followers. In another, it could be the size of a home. Regardless of what the barometer is, the fact that you desire it means that you’re looking beyond the contents of your mind and into the collective pool of society. You’re ceasing to look into what makes you uniquely you, and are gazing into the chaos of chasing that which you don’t understand.  
最终，嫉妒是不知道自己是谁的结果。当你将成功的定义外包给你所采用的任何规范时——无论是有意还是无意，它就会出现。对于一个人来说，这可能就是财富。另一方面，可能是社交媒体关注者。在另一个例子中，它可能有一个房子那么大。不管晴雨表是什么，你渴望它的事实意味着你正在超越你的思想内容并进入社会集体。你不再探究是什么让你独一无二，而是凝视着追逐你不理解的事物所带来的混乱。

One of my favorite Joker lines from _The Dark Knight_ is when he says that people are like dogs chasing cars; they won’t know what to do if they actually catch them. I find that the same thing applies to the chase of success or anything that might make you feel envious. If you got the thing that was the subject of your envy, then what? Is that it? Are you satisfied?  
《黑暗骑士》中我最喜欢的小丑台词之一是他说人们就像狗追逐汽车；如果他们真的抓住了他们，他们将不知道该怎么办。我发现同样的事情也适用于追求成功或任何可能让你感到嫉妒的事情。如果你得到了令你羡慕的东西，那又怎样呢？是这样吗？你满意吗？

Chances are, you’ll be like the dog having caught the car. There’s simply nothing you could do, except one of two things:  
很有可能，你会像狗抓住了汽车一样。除了以下两件事之一之外，您无能为力：

(1) Keep yourself busy by chasing another car, or  
(1) 通过追另一辆车让自己忙碌起来，或者

(2) Learn that this entire chase is pointless.  
(2) 明白这整个追逐是毫无意义的。

#1 is what psychologists refer to as the hedonic treadmill, while #2 is what I refer to as the antidote to envy.  
#1 是心理学家所说的享乐跑步机，而#2 是我所说的嫉妒的解药。

There is an interesting thing that happens when you see how society is organized into a giant game. You see the puppet strings of incentives and the invisible hierarchies that govern the way the pieces move, and this realization is both fascinating and disconcerting. No human being wants to be reduced to an algorithm, but it’s funny how if you get enough of us together, we behave in ways that are just as predictable as the execution of a file.  
当你看到社会是如何组织成一个巨大的游戏时，就会发生一件有趣的事情。你会看到激励的傀儡线和控制棋子移动方式的无形的等级制度，这种认识既令人着迷又令人不安。没有人愿意被简化为算法，但有趣的是，如果我们足够多的人在一起，我们的行为方式就像文件的执行一样可预测。

To see beyond the game is to direct your attention inward instead. Rather than chasing the next car, you’ll explore why you wanted to chase that car in the first place. Because if you explore your own mind’s motives in great detail, you’ll learn more about humankind than playing any game ever will.  
超越游戏的视野就是将你的注意力转向内心。您将探索为什么要追那辆车，而不是追逐下一辆车。因为如果你详细探索自己思维的动机，你将比玩任何游戏更了解人类。

> _Whatever I am,_ **_that_** _I want to understand._  
> 无论我是什么，我都想了解。

The reason why self-understanding leads to the elimination of envy is because when you explore the labyrinth of your mind, you simply have no room to want what another person has. There are more mysteries within the bounds of your own life than any novel can ever express, and this journey will take an entire lifetime to cover.  
自我理解之所以能够消除嫉妒，是因为当你探索自己的心灵迷宫时，你根本没有空间去想要别人拥有的东西。在你自己的生活中，存在着比任何小说都所能表达的更多的奥秘，而这个旅程将需要你一生的时间来探索。

Remember: You didn’t choose your genes, your parents, your upbringing, your interests. Pretty much everything of consequence is the result of happenstance, and that is where we all begin. We’re equipped with a mind and body that we didn’t choose, yet the temptation is to believe that we know who we are. Nothing could be further from the truth, and the way to get closer to this truth is not to compare yourself to another, but to know what “yourself” even means in the first place.  
请记住：你没有选择你的基因、你的父母、你的成长经历、你的兴趣。几乎所有重要的事情都是偶然的结果，这就是我们所有人的起点。我们拥有自己的思想和身体，但我们并没有选择，但我们却很容易相信自己知道自己是谁。没有什么比事实更遥远的了，而接近这个事实的方法不是将自己与他人进行比较，而是首先了解“你自己”的含义。

At its core, self-understanding is a commitment to figuring out why you think the way you think. In my case, writing these kinds of essays is my way of understanding myself. I don’t do it to build an audience or to seek recognition for them. I do it because I want to explore why I struggle with the things I struggle with, and why I love the things I love. Given that I wasn’t the conscious agent that constructed my mind, it’s up to me to figure out what’s really going on underneath the hood of it all. No one can do that but me, and no one can do that for you but you.  
从本质上讲，自我理解是致力于弄清楚为什么你会以自己的方式思考。就我而言，写这类文章是我了解自己的方式。我这样做并不是为了吸引观众或寻求他们的认可。我这样做是因为我想探索为什么我要与那些我所挣扎的事情作斗争，以及为什么我喜欢我所爱的事情。鉴于我不是构建我的思想的有意识的主体，所以我有责任弄清楚这一切背后到底发生了什么。除了我，没有人能做到这一点；除了你，没有人能为你做到这一点。

Envy is inversely correlated with self-examination. The less you know yourself, the more you look to others to get an idea of your worth. But the more you delve into who you are, the less you seek from others, and the dissolution of envy begins.  
嫉妒与自我审视呈负相关。你越不了解自己，你就越会向别人寻求帮助，以了解你的价值。但你越深入了解自己，你就越少向别人寻求，嫉妒就开始消失。
