Here's a draft bankruptcy piece about how you solve the problem of finding good people in areas you lack expertise in.  

这是一篇关于如何解决在自己不擅长的领域找到优秀人才的破产草稿。

### It's hard to find good people these days  

如今要找到好人真是不容易

How do you find a good plumber?  

你如何找到一个好的水管工？

Easy. You ask a good plumber who they'd recommend.  

很简单。你可以问一个好的水管工他们会推荐谁。

No, you can't just google for a good plumber. You'll find a plumber but they probably won't be a good one. Good plumbers mostly don't advertise, they've already got far more work than they need. Also there's a market for lemons problem with unknown tradespeople - most tradespeople are bad to OK (because most people in any job are bad to OK), the ones that are good are worth their weight in gold, but you don't know which you're getting and you don't want to pay the latter like the former and the latter don't want to work for the rate you'd be willing to pay the former.  

不，你不能只是在谷歌上搜索一个好的水管工。你会找到一个水管工，但他们可能不是好的。好的水管工大多不需要广告，他们已经有更多的工作量。此外，对于未知的技术人员存在市场上的“柠檬问题” - 大多数技术人员的水平都是差到还行（因为任何工作中的大多数人都是差到还行的），而那些好的技术人员就像黄金一样宝贵，但你不知道你得到的是哪一种，你也不想像对待前者那样支付给后者的费用，而后者也不愿意以你愿意支付给前者的费率工作。

(Why do you need a good plumber if you already know a good plumber? Well because they're a good plumber, and thus they're probably too busy for you, or because you live on a boat and they don't do boats, or because you live in a house and they don't do houses, or...)  

如果你已经认识一个好的水管工，为什么还需要另一个好的水管工呢？嗯，因为他们是好的水管工，所以他们可能太忙了没时间为你服务，或者因为你住在船上而他们不修船，或者因为你住在房子里而他们不修房子，或者...

This makes it sound harder than it is. You can also e.g. ask a good joiner who they'd recommend.  

这听起来比实际情况要难一些。你也可以问一个好的木工他们会推荐谁。

How do you find a good joiner? Well you find a good plumber and ask them who they'd recommend.  

怎样找到一个好的木工？嗯，你可以找一个好的水管工，然后问他们推荐谁。

How do you make new friends? Just go to parties and find people you hit it off with.  

你如何交新朋友？只需要去参加派对，找到与你合得来的人就行了。

How do you go to parties? Well, ask your friends to invite you along to them.  

你怎么参加派对呢？嗯，就让你的朋友邀请你一起去吧。

How do you find someone to date? Meet people through your friends.  

你如何找到约会对象？通过朋友结识新的人。

How do you make those friends? Well if the parties option isn't working out for you you can always find someone to date and make friends with their friends.  

你怎么交到那些朋友的？如果派对这个选项对你来说行不通，你总可以找个人约会，然后和他们的朋友交朋友。

How do you find a good plumber? Well you make friends with the sort of people who need plumbers and ask them for their recommendations.  

怎样找到一个好的水管工呢？嗯，你可以和那些需要水管工的人交朋友，然后向他们询问推荐。

(This mostly doesn't work in reverse, especially in the city. You probably can't make friends with your plumber - not because it's intrinsically impossible, but the interactions you have with trades people are not necessarily conducive to this. I'm sure it works for some people from time to time, but it's not a reliable strategy)  

（这在反过来的情况下通常不起作用，尤其是在城市里。你可能无法与你的水管工成为朋友 - 不是因为本质上不可能，而是你与工人的互动并不一定有利于这一点。我相信这对某些人来说有时候是有效的，但这并不是一种可靠的策略）

### It's all about who you know  

这完全取决于你认识谁

In general, the way to find the right people is to know the right people, and the right people generally form a network of similar right people, so as soon as you know some it becomes much easier to find many.  

通常来说，找到合适的人的方法就是认识合适的人，而合适的人通常会形成一个类似的人脉网络，所以一旦你认识了一些人，就会更容易找到更多合适的人。

Finding the first couple of right people can be almost impossibly hard. For some of these things (e.g. plumbers) you can solve this problem by throwing enough money at it - if you try 10 plumbers eventually one will probably be OK. You might even have the skill to be able to tell they're OK. For finding friends in a new city, you can't really buy friendship, that's not how it works.  

找到合适的人可能非常困难。对于一些事情（比如找水管工），你可以通过花足够的钱来解决这个问题 - 如果你试着找10个水管工，最终可能会有一个还不错。你甚至可能有能力判断他们是否合适。但是在一个新城市找朋友，你无法用金钱来买友谊，这不是这样运作的。

Your relationship with a network goes in roughly the following levels of strength:  

你与一个网络的关系大致可以分为以下几个强度层次：

1.  You can be completely disconnected from it.  
    
    你可以完全与之断开联系。
2.  You can be _tenuously connected_ to it - you know a small number of people in it, but not necessarily particularly robustly. It's difficult to ask favours of them because you're in a [low trust / high importance](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html) scenario. You need these people to transition to stage 3, but also if you lean on them enough to do that they might get upset with you and disconnect you from the network entirely, putting you back in stage 1.  
    
    你可能与它有一些薄弱的联系 - 你认识其中一小部分人，但并不一定非常紧密。由于处于低信任/高重要性的情境中，很难向他们请求帮助。你需要这些人过渡到第三阶段，但如果你过于依赖他们，他们可能会对你感到不满，并完全断开与你的联系，使你重新回到第一阶段。
3.  You are _well connected_ to the network - you have no trouble accessing it, and can use it in the way that you need.  
    
    您与网络连接良好 - 您可以轻松访问网络，并按照您的需求使用它。
4.  You are _part_ of the network - you don't just have access to it, members of it consider you one of them in some way, and people access you through it.  
    
    你是网络的一部分 - 你不仅仅是拥有它的权限，它的成员也认为你在某种程度上是他们中的一员，并通过它与你联系。

Moving from weaker to stronger connections to a network is what I think of as the _network bootstrapping_ problem. Your future strength is built on your current strength.  

将从较弱的连接转向更强的网络连接，这是我所认为的网络引导问题。你未来的力量是建立在你当前的力量基础上的。

Transitions from (1) to (2) and (2) to (3) are both very hard, and require quite different skillsets. I'm still myself only really figuring out what those skillsets are, but I'll do my best to explain.  

从（1）到（2）和从（2）到（3）的转变都非常困难，并且需要完全不同的技能。我自己仍然在弄清楚这些技能是什么，但我会尽力解释。

Being in stage (4) is complicated and tends to vary with types of network - with networks of friends there's a well defined transition (3) to (4). With networks of plumbers the way you become part of the network starts with being a plumber. I'm mostly not going to talk about stage 4.  

处于第四阶段是复杂的，并且往往因网络类型而异 - 在朋友圈网络中，有一个明确定义的从第三阶段到第四阶段的过渡。而在水管工网络中，成为网络的一部分的方式始于成为一名水管工。我大多数情况下不会谈论第四阶段。

### Meet the network 认识网络

Suppose you want to connect to a network that you are completely disconnected from. What do you do?  

假设你想要连接到一个你完全与之断开的网络。你该怎么办？

Well, first off, bear in mind that you might not be able to do that. Many networks are Not For People Like You - you're the wrong race, class, or gender. You didn't go to the right schools. Your family's ancestors didn't subjugate the right people three generations back along with the other members of the network. Or maybe you're just too weird and the people in the network don't want to put up with that. Some networks are just exclusive and nothing you can do will gain you access to them.  

首先，记住你可能无法做到这一点。许多网络不适合像你这样的人 - 你可能是错误的种族、阶级或性别。你没有上过正确的学校。你的家族祖先没有在三代之前与网络中的其他成员一起征服正确的人。或者也许你只是太奇怪了，网络中的人不想忍受那样的人。有些网络只是排他性的，无论你做什么都无法获得进入权限。

This is bad, obviously. I want to be clear on this: This is bad. It's a major source of inequality. I mention it not because I think this is how networks _should_ work, but because prejudice is a real thing that exists in the world and it's important to recognise that this problem is linked in with that.  

这很糟糕，显然如此。我想明确一点：这很糟糕。这是不平等的主要源头。我提到这个问题并不是因为我认为网络应该这样运作，而是因为偏见是现实存在的，我们需要认识到这个问题与偏见有关。

But assuming the network is one that you could, in principle, connect to if you knew how, how do you actually do that?  

但是假设这个网络是一个原则上你可以连接的网络，只要你知道如何连接，那么你该如何实际操作呢？

The common solution for the initial connection to a network is to bootstrap it from another network. Ask your friends about plumbers, ask your friends in one city about people to connect to in another. Turn Twitter friends into IRL friends. This works great if you already have networks you're well connected to, and those networks are ones that are well connected to other networks. It requires going out on a limb and asking for favours from people, which can be socially tricky and anxiety provoking, but most people are happy to help in this regard.  

在网络上进行初始连接的常见解决方案是从另一个网络引导它。向朋友询问水管工，向一个城市的朋友询问与另一个城市的人建立联系的方法。将Twitter上的朋友变成现实生活中的朋友。如果你已经有与之紧密联系的网络，并且这些网络与其他网络也有紧密联系，那么这种方法非常有效。这需要冒险向人们请求帮助，这可能在社交上有些棘手和令人焦虑，但大多数人乐意在这方面提供帮助。

Specific tip: It's better to ask for introductions one on one rather than e.g. posting a message on a shared group. You're more likely to get an honest response that way, and often what will happen in a shared group is that the least trustworthy member of the group will post a bad answer and other people won't find it worth the effort of arguing with you.  

具体建议：最好是私下向人们寻求介绍，而不是在共享群组上发布信息。这样你更有可能得到真诚的回应，而在共享群组中，通常会有最不可信任的成员发布错误的答案，其他人可能觉得与你争论不值得努力。

If meeting the network via one of your other networks is not really an option (e.g. because you don't really have any other networks, or because nobody in your networks knows a good plumber), you need to work harder.  

如果通过您的其他网络之一来满足网络需求并不是一个真正的选择（例如，因为您实际上没有其他网络，或者因为您的网络中没有人认识一个好的水管工），那么您需要更加努力。

I've got to be honest, I'm still figuring out how this works. Here is my very sketchy understanding of how things work:  

说实话，我还在摸索这个是怎么回事。以下是我对事情运作方式的初步了解：

1.  If you have access to existing networks you are well connected to, you really really should be using them. Ask for favours and introductions. It's scary, but it's mostly fine.  
    
    如果你能够接触到已有的人脉网络，你真的真的应该利用起来。寻求帮助和介绍。虽然有些吓人，但大多数情况下都没问题。
2.  Some networks are in some sense "open entry" in that you can gain access to them without knowing people. If you have a job, your work network is like this (Unfortunately _finding_ a job is quite network dependent. Chances are if you don't have good social connections your first job won't be very good, but you can use it to bootstrap to a better one. Recruiters are also a way of getting what is basically paid (by the company) access to a network and are less good than personal connections but cast a much broader net). There are also e.g. churches, activity groups (these haven't worked very well for me), professional networking events. These are often a good grounding for finding other higher value local networks.  
    
    有些网络在某种程度上是“开放入口”，即使不认识人也可以获得访问权限。如果你有一份工作，你的工作网络就是这样的（不幸的是，找工作很大程度上取决于人脉关系。如果你没有良好的社交关系，你的第一份工作可能不会很好，但你可以利用它来跳槽到更好的工作。招聘人员也是一种基本上是由公司支付的获取网络访问权限的方式，虽然不如个人关系好，但覆盖范围更广）。还有一些例如教堂、活动团体（对我来说效果不太好）、专业社交活动等。这些通常是找到其他更有价值的本地网络的良好基础。
3.  Often you can find people in the network you want to connect to and just cold approach them. This doesn't work for the plumber problem (because if you could find them without a network you wouldn't have the problem), but it does work for many other networks. e.g. if you want to know people in an academic discipline you can just find and follow some people on Twitter in that field who seem nice and start talking to them.  
    
    通常情况下，你可以在网络上找到你想要联系的人，并直接进行冷启动。这种方法对于解决水管工问题并不适用（因为如果你能在没有网络的情况下找到他们，你就不会有这个问题），但对于许多其他网络来说是有效的。例如，如果你想认识某个学术领域的人，你可以在Twitter上找到一些在该领域看起来友善的人，并开始与他们交流。
4.  Many networks are connected to other more visible networks. e.g. I have a hunch that if you walk up to a random house boat and say "Excuse me, I have an odd question", pause as they brace themselves for the inevitable "what's it like to live on a boat?" question and then ask "Can you recommend me a plumber?" they will be utterly nonplussed and then recommend you an excellent plumber because they're a house boater and they _definitely_ know or know someone who knows a good plumber as a result. I suspect going into a builders' merchant (which tend to be more visible) and asking one of the staff members will have a similar result.  
    
    许多网络都与其他更显眼的网络相连。例如，我有一种直觉，如果你走到一个随机的船屋前，说：“对不起，我有一个奇怪的问题”，然后停下来，等待他们为即将到来的“住在船上是什么感觉？”的问题做好准备，然后问：“你能推荐一个水管工给我吗？”他们可能会感到困惑，但最终会向你推荐一个优秀的水管工，因为他们是船屋的居民，他们肯定知道或者认识一个好的水管工。我猜测进入一个建材商店（这些商店往往更显眼），询问其中一位员工也会有类似的结果。

In general I think this is a problem that requires a level of systematicity that people often feel uncomfortable bringing to bear on social problems, and requires you to think about people in fairly strategic terms. My recommendation is to treat every individual you interact with as respect, and to otherwise suck it up and deal with it. It's unpleasant, will result in a fair bit of low-grade rejection, but generally nothing actually bad will happen and the problem is fairly amenable to hard work.  

总的来说，我认为这是一个需要一定系统性的问题，人们常常对社会问题感到不舒服，需要你从相当战略的角度思考人们。我的建议是以尊重的态度对待你与之互动的每个人，其他方面就忍耐并处理好它。这可能会令人不愉快，会导致一些低级拒绝，但一般情况下不会发生什么真正糟糕的事情，而且这个问题相当适合通过努力解决。

#### Starting from zero 从零开始

The problem is... harder if you don't have any well connected networks, which many people don't. It's been about 15 years since I've had this problem, so I may not be the best to advise on it, but here is how I understand the process to work.  

问题是...如果你没有任何良好的人脉网络，那就更难了，而很多人都没有。我已经遇到这个问题大约15年了，所以我可能不是最适合给出建议的人，但是我会告诉你我对这个过程的理解。

The basic idea is that some networks are essentially "open entry"  

基本思想是有些网络本质上是“开放入口”的

In that case the solution is to build some networks from scratch and just accept that everything is going to be much harder than it needs to be until you solve this problem, but also accept that things will become _much_ easier after you have solved this problem and thus that it is worth doing (I think a lot of people get trapped assuming that they will forever be isolated).  

在这种情况下，解决方案是从零开始建立一些网络，并且要接受一切都会比必要的困难得多，直到解决这个问题。但同时也要接受一旦解决了这个问题，事情将变得更容易，因此值得去做（我认为很多人陷入了永远被孤立的误区）。

I think the solution is to essentially start with easier to join networks. A lot of networks make it easy to attach to, because you have a natural entry point into them. For example:  

我认为解决方案是从更容易加入的网络开始。许多网络都很容易连接，因为你有一个自然的入口点。例如：

-   Getting a job gets you a professional network, which you can try to turn into a friend network.  
    
    找到一份工作可以让你建立一个专业人脉，你可以试着将其转化为一个朋友圈。
-   Making friends on Twitter is much easier than making friends offline.  
    
    在Twitter上交朋友比线下交朋友要容易得多。
-   Joining a church is supposedly a good way to connect to a pre-established network, although this didn't work for me (it was a UU church, which may not be representative of the general experience).  
    
    加入教堂被认为是与一个预先建立的网络联系的好方法，尽管对我来说并没有起作用（那是一个UU教堂，可能不代表一般经历）。
-   There are a lot of professional meetup groups that are basically explicitly networking events. Software development is particularly good for this.  
    
    有很多专业的聚会小组，基本上都是明确的社交活动。软件开发尤其适合这样的活动。
-   People always recommend activity groups for this. This maybe true, but it didn't really work out that way for me. I think there's a skill to using them this way that I lack.  
    
    人们总是推荐参加活动群组。这可能是真的，但对我来说并没有真正起作用。我觉得在这方面使用它们需要一种我所缺乏的技巧。
-   There's more support for bootstrapping a romantic partner than a friend network, so you can always find people to date using the apps and steal their friendship network (Personally I found online dating the absolute worst and cannot recommend this strategy at all, but I do know people for whom it's worked).  
    
    在寻找恋爱伴侣方面，有更多的支持，而不是朋友圈子，所以你可以通过使用应用程序找到约会对象，并借此结识他们的朋友圈子（就个人而言，我发现在线约会是最糟糕的，绝对不推荐这种策略，但我确实认识一些成功的人）。

### Connect to the network  

连接到网络

I had an empty section here. No idea what I was going to write here.  

我在这里有一个空白的部分。不知道我要在这里写什么。

### So what? 那又怎样？

I'm interested in this pattern for a couple of reasons.  

我对这个图案感兴趣有几个原因。

The first is just that sometimes I need to actually find a good plumber, or the equivalent thereof in some other field of expertise. e.g. I've been vaguely intending to find a good singing teacher and didn't have the faintest idea of where to start until one happened to attach to my network of friends (I don't yet know if she's good or not - I start next week), and I'd like to develop some general skills for doing this better.  

首先，有时候我确实需要找到一个好的水管工，或者在其他专业领域中找到相应的专家。例如，我一直有模糊的意向找一个好的声乐老师，但是在不知道从哪里开始之前，我毫无头绪，直到有一位偶然加入了我的朋友圈（我还不知道她是否好，下周我就要开始上课了）。我希望能够培养一些通用的技巧，以便更好地做到这一点。

I think some of those general skills consist of just being better about noticing this is a thing and asking for introductions.  

我认为其中一些通用技能包括更加善于注意到这一点，并主动寻求介绍。

The second is that I think it's a really underappreciated form of inequality. Having a rich set of networks that you are well attached to makes life _so_ much easier, and almost by definition we don't really notice the people on the fringes or who are not well connected to our networks. Such people are both experiencing a much harder life than people with better social connections, and also are deprived of an environment where they can learn those skills of network bootstrapping because they're not connected to anyone who can teach them!  

第二个问题是，我认为这是一种被低估的不平等形式。拥有一个丰富的人际网络，与之紧密联系，可以让生活变得更加轻松。几乎可以说，我们并没有真正注意到那些处于边缘或与我们的网络联系不紧密的人。这些人不仅经历着比那些社交关系更好的人更加艰难的生活，而且也无法在一个可以学习网络启动技巧的环境中成长，因为他们没有与能够教导他们的人建立联系！

(This also scales way further upwards than I have access to - the networks you get access to from having the right families, the right wealth, etc. are things of immense power that I have only the vaguest conception of)  

（这也远远超出了我所能接触到的范围 - 通过拥有正确的家庭、正确的财富等，你可以获得的网络是具有巨大力量的东西，而我只有模糊的概念）

One consequence of this is that if you're well connected to a network, helping other people join it is almost certainly _hugely_ life improving for them, much more so than you realise. Looking out for people who need help being onboarded into a network that they might not even know exists, and helping them connect to it, is one of the most transformative things you can do for another person, and people should do a lot more of it than they do.  

这样做的一个后果是，如果你与一个网络有很好的连接，帮助其他人加入它几乎肯定会极大地改善他们的生活，远远超出你的想象。关注那些需要帮助加入一个他们可能甚至不知道存在的网络的人，并帮助他们连接到它，是你可以为他人做的最具变革性的事情之一，人们应该做更多这样的事情。

### Postscript 附言

Not really sure why this piece was abandoned. I think it was too large and I didn't quite know what I was building up to, partially because I was theorising about a problem that I haven't had a huge amount of success with personally.  

不太确定为什么这个作品被放弃了。我觉得它太大了，而且我也不太清楚自己在构建什么，部分原因是因为我在理论上探讨了一个我个人并没有取得太大成功的问题。
