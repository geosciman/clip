What is the most uninformative statement that people are inclined to make? My nominee would be “I love to travel.” This tells you very little about a person, because nearly everyone likes to travel; and yet people say it, because, for some reason, they pride themselves both on having travelled and on the fact that they look forward to doing so.  

人们倾向于说的最没有信息量的陈述是什么？我提名的是“我喜欢旅行。”这句话对一个人来说几乎没有什么信息，因为几乎每个人都喜欢旅行；然而人们还是会说这句话，因为出于某种原因，他们为自己曾经旅行过以及期待未来旅行感到自豪。

The opposition team is small but articulate. [G. K. Chesterton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/07/07/the-back-of-the-world) wrote that “travel narrows the mind.” [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/ralph-waldo-emerson) called travel “a fool’s paradise.” Socrates and Immanuel Kant—arguably the two greatest philosophers of all time—voted with their feet, rarely leaving their respective home towns of Athens and Königsberg. But the greatest hater of travel, ever, was the Portuguese writer [Fernando Pessoa](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04/fernando-pessoas-disappearing-act), whose wonderful “[Book of Disquiet](https://www.amazon.com/Book-Disquiet-Penguin-Classics/dp/0141183047)” crackles with outrage:  

反对派团队虽小但口才了得。G·K·切斯特顿写道：“旅行会狭窄思维。”拉尔夫·沃尔多·爱默生称旅行为“愚人的天堂”。苏格拉底和伊曼纽尔·康德——可以说是有史以来最伟大的两位哲学家——用他们的脚投票，很少离开他们各自的家乡雅典和科尼斯堡。但是，有史以来最讨厌旅行的人是葡萄牙作家费尔南多·佩索阿，他的杰作《失落之书》充满了愤怒的情绪。

> I abhor new ways of life and unfamiliar places. . . . The idea of travelling nauseates me. . . . Ah, let those who don’t exist travel! . . . Travel is for those who cannot feel. . . . Only extreme poverty of the imagination justifies having to move around to feel.  
> 
> 我厌恶新的生活方式和陌生的地方……旅行的想法让我恶心……啊，让那些不存在的人去旅行吧！旅行是给那些无法感受的人的……只有极度缺乏想象力才能理解为何需要四处流浪来感受生活。

If you are inclined to dismiss this as contrarian posturing, try shifting the object of your thought from your own travel to that of others. At home or abroad, one tends to avoid “touristy” activities. “Tourism” is what we call travelling when other people are doing it. And, although people like to talk about their travels, few of us like to listen to them. Such talk resembles academic writing and reports of dreams: forms of communication driven more by the needs of the producer than the consumer.  

如果你倾向于将这视为唱反调的姿态，试着将你的思绪从自己的旅行转移到他人的旅行上。无论是在国内还是国外，人们往往会避免参与“旅游者”的活动。“旅游”是我们在别人旅行时所称呼的旅行方式。而且，尽管人们喜欢谈论自己的旅行经历，但很少有人愿意倾听他人的旅行故事。这种谈话类似于学术写作和梦境的描述：更多地是为了满足信息提供者的需求，而非信息接收者的需求。

One common argument for travel is that it lifts us into an enlightened state, educating us about the world and connecting us to its denizens. Even [Samuel Johnson](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/12/08/man-of-fetters), a skeptic—“What I gained by being in France was, learning to be better satisfied with my own country,” he once said—conceded that travel had a certain cachet. Advising his beloved Boswell, Johnson recommended a trip to China, for the sake of Boswell’s children: “There would be a lustre reflected upon them. . . . They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China.”  

旅行的一个常见论点是它让我们进入一种开明的状态，教育我们了解世界并与其居民建立联系。即使是怀疑论者塞缪尔·约翰逊也承认旅行具有一定的魅力。约翰逊曾说过：“在法国的时候，我学会了更加满足于自己的国家。”他建议心爱的博斯韦尔去中国旅行，为了博斯韦尔的孩子们：“这将给他们带来光彩……他们将始终被视为一个去看中国长城的人的孩子。”

Travel gets branded as an achievement: see interesting places, have interesting experiences, become interesting people. Is that what it really is?  

旅行被视为一种成就：看到有趣的地方，经历有趣的事情，成为有趣的人。这真的是旅行的真实含义吗？

Pessoa, Emerson, and Chesterton believed that travel, far from putting us in touch with humanity, divorced us from it. Travel turns us into the worst version of ourselves while convincing us that we’re at our best. Call this the traveller’s delusion.  

佩索阿、埃默森和切斯特顿都认为旅行并没有让我们与人类接触，反而使我们与之疏离。旅行让我们展现出最糟糕的一面，却让我们相信自己是最好的。可以称之为旅行者的错觉。

To explore it, let’s start with what we mean by “travel.” Socrates went abroad when he was called to fight in the Peloponnesian War; even so, he was no traveller. Emerson is explicit about steering his critique away from a person who travels when his “necessities” or “duties” demand it. He has no objection to traversing great distances “for the purpose of art, of study, and benevolence.” One sign that you have a reason to be somewhere is that you have nothing to prove, and therefore no drive to collect souvenirs, photos, or stories to prove it. Let’s define “tourism” as the kind of travel that aims at the interesting—and, if Emerson and company are right, misses.  

为了探索这个问题，让我们从“旅行”这个词开始。苏格拉底在被召唤参加伯罗奔尼撒战争时曾出国，但他并不是一个旅行者。爱默生明确表示，他的批评不针对那些因为“必要”或“责任”而旅行的人。他对于为了艺术、学习和善行而跨越长距离旅行并没有异议。一个你有理由去某个地方的迹象是你无需证明自己，因此也没有收集纪念品、照片或故事来证明的动力。让我们将“旅游”定义为追求有趣的旅行方式，而根据爱默生及其同伴的观点，这种方式可能会错过一些东西。

“A tourist is a temporarily leisured person who voluntarily visits a place away from home for the purpose of experiencing a change.” This definition is taken from the opening of “[Hosts and Guests](https://www.amazon.com/Hosts-Guests-Anthropology-Valene-Smith/dp/0812212800),” the classic academic volume on the anthropology of tourism. The last phrase is crucial: touristic travel exists for the sake of change. But what, exactly, gets changed? Here is a telling observation from the concluding chapter of the same book: “Tourists are less likely to borrow from their hosts than their hosts are from them, thus precipitating a chain of change in the host community.” We go to experience a change, but end up inflicting change on others.  

“游客是一种暂时闲暇的人，自愿离开家乡前往他处，以体验变化为目的。” 这个定义摘自《主人与客人》，这本经典的旅游人类学学术著作的开篇。最后一句话至关重要：旅游旅行存在的目的是为了变化。但是，到底会发生什么变化呢？同一本书的结尾章节中有一个有意思的观察：“游客不太可能向他们的主人借用，而他们的主人却更有可能向他们借用，从而引发了主人社区的一系列变化。” 我们去体验变化，但最终却给他人带来了变化。

For example, a decade ago, when I was in Abu Dhabi, I went on a guided tour of a falcon hospital. I took a photo with a falcon on my arm. I have no interest in falconry or falcons, and a generalized dislike of encounters with nonhuman animals. But the falcon hospital was one of the answers to the question, “What does one do in Abu Dhabi?” So I went. I suspect that everything about the falcon hospital, from its layout to its mission statement, is and will continue to be shaped by the visits of people like me—we unchanged changers, we tourists. (On the wall of the foyer, I recall seeing a series of “excellence in tourism” awards. Keep in mind that this is an animal hospital.)  

举个例子，十年前我在阿布扎比的时候参加了一次猎鹰医院的导览。我在手臂上和一只猎鹰合影了。我对猎鹰术或猎鹰没有兴趣，对与非人类动物的接触也普遍不感兴趣。但是猎鹰医院是回答“在阿布扎比可以做什么？”这个问题的其中一个答案。所以我去了。我怀疑猎鹰医院的一切，从布局到使命宣言，都会继续受到像我这样的游客的影响——我们这些不变的变革者，我们这些游客。（我记得在门厅的墙上看到一系列“旅游卓越奖”。请记住，这是一家动物医院。）

Why might it be bad for a place to be shaped by the people who travel there, voluntarily, for the purpose of experiencing a change? The answer is that such people not only do not know what they are doing but are not even trying to learn. Consider me. It would be one thing to have such a deep passion for falconry that one is willing to fly to Abu Dhabi to pursue it, and it would be another thing to approach the visit in an aspirational spirit, with the hope of developing my life in a new direction. I was in neither position. I entered the hospital knowing that my post-Abu Dhabi life would contain exactly as much falconry as my pre-Abu Dhabi life—which is to say, zero falconry. If you are going to see something you neither value nor aspire to value, you are not doing much of anything besides locomoting.  

一个地方被那些自愿前往体验改变的人所塑造，这会有什么不好呢？答案是这些人不仅不知道他们在做什么，而且甚至不想去学习。以我为例，如果有人对猎鹰养殖有着深深的热情，愿意飞到阿布扎比去追求，那是一回事；但如果是出于一种向往的心态，希望能够开启新的人生方向，那就是另一回事了。而我并不处于这两种情况之一。我进入医院时知道，我在阿布扎比之后的生活中，与我在之前的生活中一样，不会有任何关于猎鹰养殖的内容——也就是说，零猎鹰养殖。如果你去看一些你既不重视也不渴望重视的东西，那么你除了移动身体之外，什么也没有做。

Tourism is marked by its locomotive character. “I _went_ to France.” O.K., but what did you do there? “I _went_ to the Louvre.” O.K., but what did you do there? “I _went_ to see the ‘Mona Lisa.’ ” That is, before quickly moving on: apparently, many people spend just fifteen seconds looking at the “Mona Lisa.” It’s locomotion all the way down.  

旅游以其火车头的特点而闻名。“我去了法国。”好的，但你在那里做了什么？“我去了卢浮宫。”好的，但你在那里做了什么？“我去看‘蒙娜丽莎’。”也就是说，在迅速前进之前：显然，很多人只花了十五秒钟看‘蒙娜丽莎’。这就是一路上的火车。

The peculiar rationality of tourists allows them to be moved both by a desire to do what they are supposed to do in a place and a desire to avoid precisely what they are supposed to do. This is how it came to pass that, on my first trip to Paris, I avoided both the “Mona Lisa” and the Louvre. I did not, however, avoid locomotion. I walked from one end of the city to the other, over and over again, in a straight line; if you plotted my walks on a map, they would have formed a giant asterisk. In the many great cities I have actually lived and worked in, I would never consider spending whole days walking. When you travel, you suspend your usual standards for what counts as a valuable use of time. You suspend other standards as well, unwilling to be constrained by your taste in food, art, or recreational activities. After all, you say to yourself, the whole point of travelling is to break out of the confines of everyday life. But, if you usually avoid museums, and suddenly seek them out for the purpose of experiencing a change, what are you going to make of the paintings? You might as well be in a room full of falcons.  

游客的独特理性使他们既被想要在某个地方做的事情所感动，又被想要避免做的事情所感动。这就是为什么在我第一次去巴黎的时候，我避开了“蒙娜丽莎”和卢浮宫的原因。然而，我没有避免运动。我一遍又一遍地直线行走，从城市的一端走到另一端；如果你在地图上标出我的步行路线，它们会形成一个巨大的星号。在我实际生活和工作的许多大城市中，我从不考虑整天步行。当你旅行时，你会暂停对时间有价值的标准。你也会暂停其他标准，不愿被你对食物、艺术或娱乐活动的品味所限制。毕竟，你对自己说，旅行的整个意义就在于打破日常生活的限制。但是，如果你通常避免参观博物馆，突然寻求参观博物馆以体验变化，那么你会如何看待画作呢？你可能会觉得自己就像在一个充满猎鹰的房间里。

Let’s delve a bit deeper into how, exactly, the tourist’s project is self-undermining. I’ll illustrate with two examples from “The Loss of the Creature,” an essay by the writer Walker Percy.  

让我们深入探讨一下，究竟游客的项目是如何自我削弱的。我将以作家沃克·珀西的《物种的损失》一文中的两个例子来说明。

First, a sightseer arriving at the Grand Canyon. Before his trip, an idea of the canyon—a “symbolic complex”—had formed in his mind. He is delighted if the canyon resembles the pictures and postcards he has seen; he might even describe it as “every bit as beautiful as a picture postcard!” But, if the lighting is different, the colors and shadows not those which he expects, he feels cheated: he has arrived on a bad day. Unable to gaze directly at the canyon, forced to judge merely whether it matches an image, the sightseer “may simply be bored; or he may be conscious of the difficulty: that the great thing yawning at his feet somehow eludes him.”  

首先，一个来到大峡谷的观光者。在他旅行之前，他脑海中已经形成了一个峡谷的“象征性复杂”。如果峡谷看起来像他之前看过的照片和明信片，他会感到高兴；他甚至可能形容它为“和明信片一样美！”但是，如果光线不同，颜色和阴影与他期望的不同，他会感到被欺骗：他来的那一天运气不好。无法直接凝视峡谷，只能判断它是否与图像相符，这位观光者“可能只是感到无聊；或者他可能意识到这个困难：他脚下的伟大景色以某种方式逃避了他的视线。”

Second, a couple from Iowa driving around Mexico. They are enjoying the trip, but are a bit dissatisfied by the usual sights. They get lost, drive for hours on a rocky mountain road, and eventually, “in a tiny valley not even marked on the map,” stumble upon a village celebrating a religious festival. Watching the villagers dance, the tourists finally have “an authentic sight, a sight which is charming, quaint, picturesque, unspoiled.” Yet they still feel some dissatisfaction. Back home in Iowa, they gush about the experience to an ethnologist friend: You should have been there! You must come back with us! When the ethnologist does, in fact, return with them, “the couple do not watch the goings-on; instead they watch the ethnologist! Their highest hope is that their friend should find the dance interesting.” They need him to “certify their experience as genuine.”  

其次，来自爱荷华州的一对夫妇在墨西哥四处驾车旅行。他们享受这次旅行，但对常见的景点有些不满意。他们迷路了，在一条崎岖的山路上开了几个小时，最终“在地图上甚至没有标记的一个小山谷里”，偶然发现了一个正在庆祝宗教节日的村庄。观看村民跳舞，游客们终于看到了“一个真实的景象，一个迷人、古雅、风景如画、未受破坏的景象。”然而，他们仍然感到一些不满意。回到爱荷华州的家中，他们向一位民族学家朋友津津有味地讲述了这次经历：你应该去那里看看！你必须和我们一起回去！当这位民族学家确实和他们一起回去时，“这对夫妇并没有观看庆典的进行；相反，他们观察的是民族学家！他们最大的希望是他们的朋友能够对这场舞蹈感兴趣。”他们需要他来“证明他们的经历是真实的。”

The tourist is a deferential character. He outsources the vindication of his experiences to the ethnologist, to postcards, to conventional wisdom about what you are or are not supposed to do in a place. This deference, this “openness to experience,” is exactly what renders the tourist incapable of experience. Emerson confessed, “I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated.” He speaks for every tourist who has stood before a monument, or a painting, or a falcon, and demanded herself to feel something. Emerson and Percy help us understand why this demand is unreasonable: to be a tourist is to have already decided that it is not one’s own feelings that count. Whether an experience is authentically X is precisely what you, as a non-X, cannot judge.  

旅游者是一种恭敬的角色。他将自己的经历的证明外包给民族学家、明信片，以及关于在某个地方该做什么或不该做什么的传统智慧。这种恭敬，这种“开放经验”的态度，正是使旅游者无法体验的原因。爱默生承认，“我寻找梵蒂冈和宫殿。我假装被景象和启示所陶醉，但我并没有陶醉。”他代表了每一个站在纪念碑、画作或猎鹰前的旅游者，试图让自己感受到某种东西。爱默生和珀西帮助我们理解为什么这种要求是不合理的：成为旅游者意味着你已经决定了自己的感受并不重要。一个经历是否真正地X，恰恰是你作为一个非X的人无法判断的。

A similar argument applies to the tourist’s impulse to honor the grand sea of humanity. Whereas Percy and Emerson focus on the aesthetic, showing us how hard it is for travellers to have the sensory experiences that they seek, Pessoa and Chesterton are interested in the ethical. They study why travellers can’t truly connect to other human beings. During my Paris wanderings, I would stare at people, intently inspecting their clothing, their demeanor, their interactions. I was trying to see the Frenchness in the French people around me. This is not a way to make friends.  

类似的论点也适用于游客对人类大海的敬仰之情。而佩西和爱默生关注的是审美，向我们展示了旅行者很难获得他们所追求的感官体验。而佩索阿和切斯特顿则对伦理问题感兴趣。他们研究了为什么旅行者无法真正与其他人类建立联系。在我在巴黎漫步时，我会盯着人们看，仔细观察他们的服装、举止和互动。我试图从周围的法国人身上看到法国的特质。但这并不是交朋友的方式。

Pessoa said that he knew only one “real traveller with soul”: an office boy who obsessively collected brochures, tore maps out of newspapers, and memorized train schedules between far-flung destinations. The boy could recount sailing routes around the world, but he had never left Lisbon. Chesterton also approved of such stationary travellers. He wrote that there was “something touching and even tragic” about “the thoughtless tourist, who might have stayed at home loving Laplanders, embracing Chinamen, and clasping Patagonians to his heart in Hampstead or Surbiton, but for his blind and suicidal impulse to go and see what they looked like.”  

佩索阿说他只认识一个“有灵魂的真正旅行者”：一个痴迷地收集旅游手册、从报纸上撕下地图并记住遥远目的地之间的火车时刻表的办公室男孩。这个男孩能够讲述世界各地的航线，但他从未离开过里斯本。切斯特顿也赞同这样的固定旅行者。他写道，“那些不经思考的游客，本可以待在家里爱上拉普兰人，拥抱中国人，在汉普斯特德或萨比顿把巴塔哥尼亚人紧紧拥入怀中，但却因为盲目和自杀的冲动去看看他们长什么样子”，这种想法“令人感动甚至悲伤”。

The problem was not with other places, or with the man wanting to see them, but with travel’s dehumanizing effect, which thrust him among people to whom he was forced to relate as a spectator. Chesterton believed that loving what is distant in the proper fashion—namely, from a distance—enabled a more universal connection. When the man in Hampstead thought of foreigners “in the abstract . . . as those who labour and love their children and die, he was thinking the fundamental truth about them.” “The human bond that he feels at home is not an illusion,” Chesterton wrote. “It is rather an inner reality.” Travel prevents us from feeling the presence of those we have travelled such great distances to be near.  

问题不在于其他地方，也不在于那个想要去看它们的人，而在于旅行的非人性化效应，它将他推到了他被迫以旁观者的身份与人们交往的境地。切斯特顿相信，以适当的方式爱远方的事物——也就是从远处爱——能够建立更普遍的联系。当汉普斯特德的那个人把外国人“抽象地看待……作为那些劳动、爱护子女并最终死去的人时，他正在思考关于他们的根本真理。”切斯特顿写道：“他在家中感受到的人类纽带并非幻觉，而是一种内在的现实。”旅行阻止我们感受到那些我们为了靠近而走过如此长距离的人的存在。

The single most important fact about tourism is this: we already know what we will be like when we return. A vacation is not like immigrating to a foreign country, or matriculating at a university, or starting a new job, or falling in love. We embark on those pursuits with the trepidation of one who enters a tunnel not knowing who she will be when she walks out. The traveller departs confident that she will come back with the same basic interests, political beliefs, and living arrangements. Travel is a boomerang. It drops you right where you started.  

旅游最重要的事实是：我们已经知道回来时会是什么样子。度假不像移民到外国、入读大学、开始新工作或坠入爱河。我们开始这些追求时，会像进入一个隧道的人一样感到不安，不知道走出来时会变成什么样子。旅行者则自信地出发，相信回来时自己的基本兴趣、政治信仰和生活安排不会有太大变化。旅行就像一个回旋镖，它会把你带回原点。

If you think that this doesn’t apply to you—that your own travels are magical and profound, with effects that deepen your values, expand your horizons, render you a true citizen of the globe, and so on—note that this phenomenon can’t be assessed first-personally. Pessoa, Chesterton, Percy, and Emerson were all aware that travellers _tell themselves_ they’ve changed, but you can’t rely on introspection to detect a delusion. So cast your mind, instead, to any friends who are soon to set off on summer adventures. In what condition do you expect to find them when they return? They may speak of their travel as though it were transformative, a “once in a lifetime” experience, but will you be able to notice a difference in their behavior, their beliefs, their moral compass? Will there be any difference at all?  

如果你认为这不适用于你，认为你自己的旅行是神奇而深刻的，能够加深你的价值观，拓宽你的视野，使你成为真正的全球公民等等，那么请注意，这种现象无法从第一人称角度评估。佩索阿、切斯特顿、珀西和爱默生都意识到旅行者会告诉自己他们已经改变了，但你不能依赖内省来发现一个幻觉。所以，反而想想那些即将开始夏季冒险的朋友们。你期望他们回来时会处于什么状态？他们可能会把旅行说得像是一次改变命运的经历，一次“一生一次”的体验，但你能否注意到他们的行为、信仰、道德准则有所不同？是否会有任何不同之处呢？

Travel is fun, so it is not mysterious that we like it. What _is_ mysterious is why we imbue it with a vast significance, an aura of virtue. If a vacation is merely the pursuit of unchanging change, an embrace of nothing, why insist on its meaning?  

旅行很有趣，所以我们喜欢它并不奇怪。奇怪的是为什么我们赋予它如此重要的意义，一种美德的光环。如果度假只是追求不变的变化，拥抱虚无，为什么要坚持它的意义呢？

One is forced to conclude that maybe it isn’t so easy to do nothing—and this suggests a solution to the puzzle. Imagine how your life would look if you discovered that you would never again travel. If you aren’t planning a major life change, the prospect looms, terrifyingly, as “More and more of _this_, and then I die.” Travel splits this expanse of time into the chunk that happens before the trip, and the chunk that happens after it, obscuring from view the certainty of annihilation. And it does so in the cleverest possible way: by giving you a foretaste of it. You don’t like to think about the fact that someday you will do nothing and be nobody. You will only allow yourself to preview this experience when you can disguise it in a narrative about how you are doing many exciting and edifying things: you are experiencing, you are connecting, you are being transformed, and you have the trinkets and photos to prove it.  

不得不得出这样的结论，也许什么都不做并不那么容易，这就暗示了这个谜题的解决办法。想象一下，如果你发现自己再也不会旅行，你的生活会是什么样子。如果你没有计划进行重大的生活改变，那么这个前景会可怕地笼罩着你，就像是“越来越多的这种生活，然后我就死了。”旅行将这段时间分割成旅行之前和旅行之后的两个部分，掩盖了死亡的必然性。而且它以最巧妙的方式做到了这一点：通过给你一个预感。你不愿意去想，总有一天你会什么都不做，成为一个无名之辈。只有在你能够将其伪装成一个关于你正在做许多令人兴奋和有益的事情的故事时，你才会允许自己预览这种经历：你正在体验，你正在连接，你正在改变，你有纪念品和照片来证明这一切。

Socrates said that philosophy is a preparation for death. For everyone else, there’s travel. ♦  

苏格拉底曾说过，哲学是为死亡做准备。而对于其他人来说，旅行就是最好的准备。♦
