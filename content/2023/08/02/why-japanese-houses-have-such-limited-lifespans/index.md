EVERY 20 years in the eastern coastal Japanese city of Ise, the shrine, one of the country’s most venerated, is knocked down and rebuilt. The ritual is believed to refresh spiritual bonds between the people and the gods. Demolishing houses has no such lofty objective. Yet in Japan they have a similarly short life expectancy.  

每隔 20 年，日本东部沿海城市伊势就会推倒并重建一座神社，它是日本最令人尊敬的神社之一。人们相信，这种仪式可以刷新人与神之间的精神纽带。拆除房屋则没有这样崇高的目标。然而，在日本，房屋的寿命同样很短。

According to Nomura, a brokerage, the value of the average Japanese house depreciates to zero in 22 years. (It is calculated separately from the land, which is more likely to hold its value.) Most are knocked down and rebuilt. Sales of new homes far outstrip those of used ones, which usually change hands in the expectation that they will be demolished and replaced. In America and Europe second-hand houses accounted for 90% of sales and new-builds for 10% in 2017. In Japan the proportions are the other way around.  

根据经纪公司野村（Nomura）的数据，日本普通住宅的价值在 22 年内贬值为零（这是与土地分开计算的，土地更有可能保值）。(这是与土地分开计算的，土地更有可能保值）。大部分房屋被推倒重建。新房的销售量远远超过二手房的销售量，因为二手房通常是在预期会被拆除和更换的情况下转手的。2017 年，在美国和欧洲，二手房占销售额的 90%，新建住宅占 10%。在日本，这一比例正好相反。

The reasons for Japanese houses’ rapid loss of value lie partly in tradition. In many countries people buy when they pair off, when they move to a bigger place after they have children or when they downsize on retirement. Japanese people have tended to see out all life’s stages in the same dwelling, a custom they attribute to their history as a farming nation, when they had to stay put. As a result, they never got used to second-hand homes.  

日本房屋迅速贬值的部分原因在于传统。在许多国家，人们在成双成对、有了孩子后搬到更大的地方或退休后缩小规模时都会买房。日本人倾向于在同一住宅中度过人生的所有阶段，他们将这一习俗归因于作为农业国的历史，当时他们不得不原地不动。因此，他们从未习惯过二手房。

The frequency of earthquakes also plays a part. Large tremors tend to be followed by tougher building regulations. Many people want to live in a home built to the most recent standards. History also helped to form habits. During the second world war dozens of cities, including Tokyo, had been flattened by American bombs. The population then was growing fast. Quantity was valued over quality. Big prefab manufacturers, such as Daiwa House, survive to this day, bringing out new models every year that, as with cars, people aspire to upgrade to.  

地震的频率也是一个因素。大地震之后，建筑法规往往会更加严格。许多人都想住在按照最新标准建造的房子里。历史也有助于形成习惯。第二次世界大战期间，包括东京在内的数十座城市被美国炸弹夷为平地。当时人口增长迅速。数量比质量更重要。大和房屋等大型预制房屋制造商一直生存至今，每年都会推出新款房屋，就像汽车一样，人们渴望升级换代。

## One careless owner 一个粗心的主人

In a vicious cycle, houses are expected to depreciate and are therefore not maintained, so second-hand homes are often dingy and depressing. Japanese people also shun _wake-ari bukken_, buildings “stigmatised” because, say, a former resident committed suicide there or a cult resides nearby. “In Japan, the words old and charming do not go together,” says Noriko Kagami, an estate agent (who tore down a house she bought herself).  

在一个恶性循环中，人们预期房屋会贬值，因此不对其进行维护，所以二手房往往阴暗、压抑。日本人还避开 "WAKE-ARI BUKKEN"，即那些因为曾经有人在此自杀或附近有邪教组织而被 "污名化 "的建筑。"房产中介 Noriko Kagami 说："在日本，古老和迷人这两个词是不搭边的。

Unsurprisingly, given the speed at which the value of houses falls to nothing, banks are more willing to offer loans for new places. Government policy, long aimed at resolving a housing shortage, further skews housebuyers’ incentives. It is not tax-efficient to improve a house, says Daisuke Fukushima of Nomura, since property taxes are based on value. Someone who buys a new-build must pay 0.4% of its value to register ownership. Registering a change of ownership costs 2%.  

毫不奇怪，考虑到房屋贬值的速度，银行更愿意为新房提供贷款。长期以来旨在解决住房短缺问题的政府政策进一步扭曲了购房者的积极性。野村（Nomura）的福岛大辅（Daisuke Fukushima）说，改善住房条件并不划算，因为房产税是根据价值征收的。购买新建房屋的人必须支付房屋价值的 0.4% 来登记所有权。所有权变更登记费用为 2%。

Construction and home-fitting companies benefit from this speedy housing cycle. But in the longer term is it wasteful. Chie Nozawa of Toyo University compares it to slash-and-burn farming. “We are not building wealth,” says Yasuhiko Nakajo, who leads the property department at Meikai University.  

建筑公司和房屋装修公司从这种快速的住房周期中获益。但从长远来看，这是一种浪费。东洋大学的野泽千惠将其比作刀耕火种。"明海大学房地产系主任 Yasuhiko Nakajo 说："我们没有在创造财富。

When the number of mouths to feed is growing, slash-and-burn at least makes short-term sense. But Japan’s throwaway housing culture, shaped by a once-urgent need to house growing numbers, makes no sense now that the population is shrinking. The country currently has an estimated 10m abandoned homes, a number that is expected to rise above 20m by 2033.  

当需要养活的人越来越多时，刀耕火种至少在短期内是合理的。但是，日本的弃房文化是在曾经急需为越来越多的人提供住房的情况下形成的，在人口不断减少的今天，这种文化已经失去了意义。据估计，日本目前有 1,000 万套废弃房屋，预计到 2033 年，这一数字将超过 2,000 万套。

That is a problem for entire neighbourhoods: a derelict lot drags down the value of nearby houses. It also complicates the transfer of wealth from the big post-war generation. A house that is worth nothing cannot be sold to pay for an assisted-living apartment or a place in a nursing home, or handed on as an inheritance.  

这对整个街区都是一个问题：一块荒废的土地会拖累附近房屋的价值。这也使战后一代人的财富转移变得更加复杂。一文不值的房子既不能卖掉以支付辅助生活公寓或养老院的费用，也不能作为遗产继承。

The government has, belatedly, started to rethink its policies. It set itself the target of doubling the number of used-housing sales in 2020 compared with ten years earlier, and is strengthening a home-surveying system introduced in 2013. From next month estate agents will have to give prospective buyers more information, including disclosing the results of any inspection. Much still remains unclear, though, including how long the results of a survey will remain valid, and whether the seller will be liable for defects that were not disclosed during the sale.  

政府已经开始反思其政策，但为时已晚。政府为自己设定的目标是在 2020 年将二手房销售量比十年前翻一番，并正在加强 2013 年推出的房屋检测系统。从下个月起，房产中介必须向潜在买家提供更多信息，包括披露任何检查结果。但仍有许多问题尚不明确，包括调查结果的有效期有多长，以及卖方是否要对销售过程中未披露的缺陷负责等。

The government is also considering reducing the taxes associated with buying a home if it is currently vacant. Some regions are offering incentives to buyers of abandoned homes, including financial aid and lower taxes.  

政府还在考虑降低购买空置房屋的相关税费。一些地区正在为废弃房屋的购买者提供激励措施，包括财政援助和降低税收。

Banks are becoming a little more forthcoming with loans for second-hand housing. Some housing companies are starting to offer renovation and refurbishment services. When Motoazabu Hills, a posh building of rented apartments in central Tokyo, recently changed hands, the new owner decided to gut and redo the interiors rather than knock the whole thing down. _AERA_, a magazine, recently published a guide to buying property that will retain its value. Among its tips was to buy in an area that is home to lots of women in their 20s and 30s (ie, of childbearing age).  

银行对二手房贷款的态度越来越积极。一些住房公司也开始提供翻新和翻修服务。最近，东京市中心一栋高档出租公寓元气山庄（Motoazabu Hills）易手，新房主决定对内部进行翻新和重新装修，而不是整体推倒。AERA 杂志最近出版了一本关于购买保值房产的指南。其中一条建议是，在二三十岁（即育龄期）女性较多的地区购买房产。

All this is having some success. In the cities a larger share of people now rent than own places, and move more often. “We are entering a stage where people are starting to see a used home as an option,” says Mr Nakajo. In 2017 a record 37,329 second-hand flats were sold in Tokyo, a 31% increase on ten years earlier. Yet until what Mr Nakajo dubs the “20-year-mentality” changes, the preference for shiny and new will remain.  

所有这一切都取得了一些成功。在城市里，现在租房的人比买房的人多，而且搬家的频率也更高。"中条先生说："我们正在进入一个阶段，人们开始将二手房视为一种选择。2017 年，东京售出了创纪录的 37329 套二手房，比十年前增加了 31%。然而，在中条先生所称的 "20 年心态 "发生改变之前，人们对闪亮新房的偏好仍将存在。
