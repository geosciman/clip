![How to Do Great Work](how-to-do-great-work-1.gif)July 2023  

2023年7月

If you collected lists of techniques for doing great work in a lot of different fields, what would the intersection look like? I decided to find out by making it.

  

如果你收集了在许多不同领域做伟大工作的技术清单，那么这个交叉点会是什么样子？我决定通过制作它来寻找答案。

Partly my goal was to create a guide that could be used by someone working in any field. But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled "work hard."

  

我的部分目标是创建一个可以被在任何领域工作的人使用的指南。但我也对交叉点的形状感到好奇。这个练习表明，它确实有一个明确的形状；它不只是一个标有 "努力工作 "的点。

The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.

  

下面的食谱假设你很有野心。

The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.

  

第一步是决定从事什么工作。你选择的工作需要具备三个方面的素质：它必须是你有天赋的东西，你对它有浓厚的兴趣，并能提供做伟大工作的空间。

In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.

\[[1](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f1n)\]  

在实践中，你不必太担心第三条标准。有雄心壮志的人在这方面已经太保守了。因此，你需要做的就是找到你有能力和巨大兴趣的东西。\[1\]

That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet. So while some people know what they want to do at 14, most have to figure it out.

  

这听起来很简单，但往往相当困难。当你年轻时，你不知道自己擅长什么，也不知道不同种类的工作是什么样的。你最终要做的一些工作甚至可能还不存在。因此，虽然有些人在14岁时就知道自己想做什么，但大多数人必须自己想办法。

The way to figure out what to work on is by working. If you're not sure what to work on, guess. But pick something and get going. You'll probably guess wrong some of the time, but that's fine. It's good to know about multiple things; some of the biggest discoveries come from noticing connections between different fields.

  

弄清工作内容的方法是通过工作。如果你不确定要做什么，那就猜吧。但要挑选一些东西，然后开始工作。你可能在某些时候会猜错，但这很好。了解多种事物是好事；一些最大的发现来自于注意到不同领域之间的联系。

Develop a habit of working on your own projects. Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.

  

养成在自己的项目上工作的习惯。不要让 "工作 "意味着其他人告诉你要做的事情。如果有一天你真的设法做了伟大的工作，这可能是你自己的项目。它可能是在某个更大的项目中，但你将推动你的部分。

What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge. At 7 it may seem excitingly ambitious to build huge things out of Lego, then at 14 to teach yourself calculus, till at 21 you're starting to explore unanswered questions in physics. But always preserve excitingness.

  

你的项目应该是什么？在你看来是令人激动的雄心勃勃的东西。随着你年龄的增长和你对项目的品味的演变，令人兴奋的和重要的将趋于一致。在7岁时，用乐高积木建造巨大的东西可能看起来很有野心，然后在14岁时教自己微积分，直到21岁时你开始探索物理学的未解之谜。但要始终保持兴奋性。

There's a kind of excited curiosity that's both the engine and the rudder of great work. It will not only drive you, but if you let it have its way, will also show you what to work on.

  

有一种兴奋的好奇心，既是伟大工作的引擎，也是舵手。它不仅会驱使你，而且如果你让它得逞，也会告诉你该做什么工作。

What are you excessively curious about — curious to a degree that would bore most other people? That's what you're looking for.

  

你对什么过分好奇--好奇的程度会让大多数人感到厌烦？这就是你要找的东西。

Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.

  

一旦你找到了你极度感兴趣的东西，下一步就是学习足够的知识，使你达到知识的前沿之一。知识是以分形方式扩展的，从远处看它的边缘是平滑的，但一旦你学习到足够多的知识，接近其中一个，它们就会变成充满差距的。

The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted.

\[[2](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f2n)\]  

下一步是注意它们。这需要一些技巧，因为你的大脑想要忽略这些差距，以便为世界建立一个更简单的模型。许多发现都来自于对其他人认为理所当然的事情提出问题。\[2\]

If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math. It would be affected to try to manufacture it, but if it appears, embrace it.

  

如果答案看起来很奇怪，那就更好了。伟大的作品往往有一种奇怪的色彩。从绘画到数学你都能看到这一点。试图制造它将会受到影响，但如果它出现了，就拥抱它。

Boldly chase outlier ideas, even if other people aren't interested in them — in fact, especially if they aren't. If you're excited about some possibility that everyone else ignores, and you have enough expertise to say precisely what they're all overlooking, that's as good a bet as you'll find.

\[[3](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f3n)\]  

大胆地追逐离群的想法，即使其他人对它们不感兴趣--事实上，特别是如果他们不感兴趣的话。如果你对其他所有人都忽视的某种可能性感到兴奋，而且你有足够的专业知识，可以准确地说出他们都忽视了什么，这就是你会发现的好赌注。\[3\]

Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. This is how practically everyone who's done great work has done it, from painters to physicists.

  

四个步骤：选择一个领域，学习足够的知识以进入前沿领域，注意差距，探索有前途的领域。从画家到物理学家，几乎所有做过伟大工作的人都是这样做的。

Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.

  

第二步和第四步将需要努力工作。也许无法证明你必须努力工作才能做伟大的事情，但经验证据的规模与死亡率的证据相当。这就是为什么在你深感兴趣的事情上工作是至关重要的。兴趣会促使你比单纯的勤奋更努力工作。

The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all.

  

三个最强大的动机是好奇心、喜悦和想做一些令人印象深刻的事情的愿望。有时它们会交汇在一起，这种组合是最强大的。

The big prize is to discover a new fractal bud. You notice a crack in the surface of knowledge, pry it open, and there's a whole world inside.

  

大奖是发现一个新的分形芽。你注意到知识表面的一个裂缝，撬开它，里面就有一个完整的世界。

Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information.

\[[4](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f4n)\]  

让我们再来谈一谈确定工作内容的复杂事务。这很难的主要原因是，你无法知道大多数工作是什么样的，除非你去做。这意味着这四个步骤是重叠的：在你知道自己有多喜欢某项工作或自己有多擅长某项工作之前，你可能必须在某项工作上工作多年。而在这期间，你并没有做，因此也没有学习大多数其他种类的工作。因此，在最坏的情况下，你会根据非常不完整的信息选择迟到。\[4\]

The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.

  

野心的性质使这个问题更加严重。野心有两种形式，一种是先于对该主题的兴趣，另一种是由该主题发展出来的。大多数做伟大工作的人都有两种形式，前者越多，就越难决定做什么。

The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.

  

大多数国家的教育系统假装这很容易。他们希望你在了解一个领域的真实情况之前，就已经投入到这个领域。因此，一个处于最佳轨道上的雄心勃勃的人往往会把这个系统当作一个破绽来读。

It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.

  

如果他们至少承认这一点会更好--如果他们承认这个系统不仅不能帮助你找出工作内容，而且是在假设你作为一个青少年会以某种方式神奇地猜到的基础上设计的。他们没有告诉你，但我要告诉你：当涉及到弄清楚要做什么工作时，你要靠自己。有些人很幸运，确实猜对了，但其他人会发现自己在假设每个人都猜对的轨道上斜着走。

What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.

\[[5](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f5n)\]  

如果你年轻，有雄心壮志，但不知道该做什么工作，你应该怎么做？你不应该做的是被动地随波逐流，假设问题会自己解决。你需要采取行动。但没有系统的程序可以遵循。当你阅读那些做了伟大工作的人的传记时，会发现其中有很多运气。他们在一次偶然的会面中发现了要做的事情，或者通过阅读他们碰巧拿起的一本书。因此，你需要让自己成为运气的大目标，而做到这一点的方法就是要有好奇心。尝试很多事情，遇到很多人，读很多书，问很多问题。\[5\]

When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become _increasingly_ interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.

  

在有疑问的时候，要对有趣性进行优化。领域会随着你对其了解的加深而改变。例如，数学家所做的事与你在高中数学课上所做的事有很大不同。因此，你需要给不同类型的工作一个机会，向你展示它们是什么样的。但是，随着你对一个领域了解的加深，它应该变得越来越有趣。如果不是这样，它可能不适合你。

Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive. And you're more likely to find new things if you're looking where few have looked before.

  

如果你发现你对不同的事情感兴趣，不要担心。你的兴趣口味越奇怪越好。陌生的品味往往是强烈的品味，而强烈的工作品味意味着你会有成就感。而且，如果你在以前很少有人关注的地方寻找，你就更有可能发现新的东西。

One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening.

  

你适合某种工作的一个标志是，你甚至喜欢其他人认为乏味或可怕的部分。

But fields aren't people; you don't owe them any loyalty. If in the course of working on one thing you discover another that's more exciting, don't be afraid to switch.

  

但领域不是人；你不欠他们任何忠诚。如果在工作过程中，你发现另一件事更令人兴奋，不要害怕转换。

If you're making something for people, make sure it's something they actually want. The best way to do this is to make something you yourself want. Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience.

  

如果你要为人们做一些东西，确保它是他们真正想要的东西。做到这一点的最好方法是制作你自己想要的东西。写下你想读的故事；建造你想使用的工具。由于你的朋友可能有类似的兴趣，这也将使你获得最初的观众。

This _should_ follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost.

\[[6](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f6n)\]  

这应该来自于兴奋性规则。显然，写得最激动人心的故事将是你想看的故事。我之所以明确提到这个案例，是因为很多人都搞错了。他们不是写自己想要的东西，而是试图写一些想象中的、更复杂的观众想要的东西。而一旦你走了这条路，你就会迷失。\[6\]

There are a lot of forces that will lead you astray when you're trying to figure out what to work on. Pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, eminent frauds. But if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray.

  

当你试图找出工作内容时，有很多力量会把你引入歧途。自命不凡、时尚、恐惧、金钱、政治、其他人的愿望、知名的骗子。但是，如果你坚持做你认为真正有趣的事情，你就能抵御所有这些东西。如果你有兴趣，你就不会误入歧途。

Following your interests may sound like a rather passive strategy, but in practice it usually means following them past all sorts of obstacles. You usually have to risk rejection and failure. So it does take a good deal of boldness.

  

追随你的兴趣可能听起来是一个相当被动的策略，但在实践中，这通常意味着追随他们穿过各种各样的障碍。你通常必须冒着被拒绝和失败的风险。因此，这确实需要很大的勇气。

But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.

  

但是，虽然你需要勇气，但你通常不需要太多的计划。在大多数情况下，做伟大工作的秘诀很简单：在令人激动的雄心勃勃的项目上努力工作，就会有好的结果。你不需要制定计划，也不需要执行计划，你只需要努力保持某些不变量。

The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.

  

计划的麻烦在于，它只对你能提前描述的成就有效。你可以通过小时候的决定赢得金牌或致富，然后顽强地追求这个目标，但你无法通过这种方式发现自然选择。

I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.

  

我认为对于大多数想做伟大工作的人来说，正确的策略是不要计划太多。在每个阶段，做任何看起来最有趣的事情，为你的未来提供最好的选择。我把这种方法称为 "保持逆风"。这就是大多数做过伟大工作的人似乎都是这样做的。

Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work. But there will also be plenty of times when things aren't like that.

  

即使你已经找到了令人兴奋的工作，工作起来也并不总是一帆风顺的。有的时候，一些新的想法会让你在早上从床上跳起来，直接开始工作。但也会有很多时候，事情并不是这样的。

You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration. There are headwinds and currents and hidden shoals. So there's a technique to working, just as there is to sailing.

  

你不能只是把你的帆伸出来，然后被灵感吹向前方。有逆风、水流和隐藏的浅滩。所以工作是有技巧的，就像航海一样。

For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.

  

例如，虽然你必须努力工作，但也有可能工作得太辛苦，如果你这样做，你会发现你得到的回报越来越少：疲劳会使你变得愚蠢，最后甚至损害你的健康。工作产生收益递减的时间点取决于类型。一些最难的类型，你可能每天只能做四或五个小时。

Ideally those hours will be contiguous. To the extent you can, try to arrange your life so you have big blocks of time to work in. You'll shy away from hard tasks if you know you might be interrupted.

  

理想情况下，这些时间将是连续的。在你能做到的范围内，尽量安排你的生活，让你有大块的时间来工作。如果你知道你可能会被打断，你就会对困难的任务望而却步。

It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character. Work has a sort of activation energy, both per day and per project. And since this threshold is fake in the sense that it's higher than the energy required to keep going, it's ok to tell yourself a lie of corresponding magnitude to get over it.

  

开始工作可能会比继续工作更难。你常常不得不欺骗自己，以克服最初的门槛。不要担心这个；这是工作的性质，不是你性格中的缺陷。工作有一种激活的能量，无论是每天还是每个项目。既然这个阈值是假的，即它高于继续前进所需的能量，那么告诉自己一个相应程度的谎言来克服它也是可以的。

It's usually a mistake to lie to yourself if you want to do great work, but this is one of the rare cases where it isn't. When I'm reluctant to start work in the morning, I often trick myself by saying "I'll just read over what I've got so far." Five minutes later I've found something that seems mistaken or incomplete, and I'm off.

  

如果你想做伟大的工作，对自己撒谎通常是个错误，但这是极少数不撒谎的情况之一。当我不愿意在早上开始工作时，我经常欺骗自己说："我就把目前得到的东西读一遍"。五分钟后，我发现了一些似乎是错误的或不完整的东西，然后我就走了。

Similar techniques work for starting new projects. It's ok to lie to yourself about how much work a project will entail, for example. Lots of great things began with someone saying "How hard could it be?"

  

类似的技巧也适用于开始新项目。例如，在一个项目将需要多少工作的问题上对自己撒谎是可以的。很多伟大的事情都是从有人说 "这能有多难 "开始的。

This is one case where the young have an advantage. They're more optimistic, and even though one of the sources of their optimism is ignorance, in this case ignorance can sometimes beat knowledge.

  

这是年轻人有优势的一个案例。他们更乐观，尽管他们乐观的来源之一是无知，但在这种情况下，无知有时可以战胜知识。

Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline. In many projects a lot of the best work happens in what was meant to be the final stage.

  

不过，要尽量完成你开始的工作，即使结果是比你预期的要多。完成事情不仅仅是一种整洁或自律的练习。在许多项目中，许多最好的工作都发生在本应是最后阶段的地方。

Another permissible lie is to exaggerate the importance of what you're working on, at least in your own mind. If that helps you discover something new, it may turn out not to have been a lie after all.

\[[7](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f7n)\]  

另一个可以允许的谎言是夸大你正在做的事情的重要性，至少在你自己心中是这样。如果这能帮助你发现一些新的东西，那么它可能会被证明不是一个谎言。\[7\]

Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done.

\[[8](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f8n)\]  

既然有两种意义上的开始工作--每天和每个项目--也有两种形式的拖延。每个项目的拖延是更危险的。你把那个雄心勃勃的项目从一年拖到一年，因为时间还不太合适。当你以年为单位进行拖延时，你会有很多事情没有完成。\[8\]

One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.

  

每个项目的拖延如此危险的原因之一是，它通常将自己伪装成工作。你不是无所事事地坐着，而是在勤奋地做其他事情。因此，每个项目的拖延并不像每天的拖延那样发出警报。你太忙了，没有注意到这一点。

The way to beat it is to stop occasionally and ask yourself: Am I working on what I most want to work on?" When you're young it's ok if the answer is sometimes no, but this gets increasingly dangerous as you get older.

\[[9](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f9n)\]  

打败它的方法是偶尔停下来问问自己：我是否在做我最想做的事情？"当你年轻的时候，如果答案有时是否定的，那也没关系，但随着你年龄的增长，这将变得越来越危险。\[9\]

Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.

  

伟大的工作通常需要在一个问题上花费在大多数人看来是不合理的时间。你不能把这个时间看作是一种成本，否则就会显得太高。你必须发现工作在发生时有足够的吸引力。

There may be some jobs where you have to work diligently for years at things you hate before you get to the good part, but this is not how great work happens. Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.

  

也许有一些工作，你必须在你讨厌的事情上勤奋工作数年，然后才能进入好的部分，但这不是伟大工作的发生方式。伟大的工作是通过持续专注于你真正感兴趣的事情而发生的。当你停下脚步进行评估时，你会惊讶地发现自己已经走了多远。

The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

  

我们感到惊讶的原因是，我们低估了工作的累积效应。每天写一页听起来不多，但如果你每天都这样做，一年就能写一本书。这就是关键所在：一致性。做大事的人不会每天都做很多事。他们会做一些事情，而不是什么都不做。

If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.

  

如果你做的工作是复利的，你就会得到指数式的增长。大多数这样做的人都是无意识的，但这值得停下来想一想。例如，学习就是这种现象的一个例子：你对某件事情了解得越多，就越容易学到更多。拓展受众是另一个例子：你的粉丝越多，他们会给你带来更多的新粉丝。

The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.

  

指数增长的问题是，曲线在开始时感觉是平的。其实不然，它仍然是一条美妙的指数曲线。但我们不能从直觉上把握住这一点，所以我们在早期阶段低估了指数增长。

Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.

  

成倍增长的东西可以变得如此有价值，以至于值得做出非凡的努力来让它开始。但是，由于我们在早期低估了指数增长，这也大多是在无意识的情况下进行的：人们在学习新事物的最初、无回报的阶段进行推动，因为他们从经验中知道，学习新事物总是需要最初的推动，或者他们每次都在增长他们的观众，因为他们没有更好的事情可做。如果人们有意识地意识到他们可以投资于指数式增长，那么更多的人会这样做。

Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.

  

工作并不只是在你努力的时候发生。你在走路、洗澡或躺在床上时，有一种不定向的思考，可以非常有力。通过让你的思想游离一下，你往往会解决你无法通过正面攻击解决的问题。

You have to be working hard in the normal way to benefit from this phenomenon, though. You can't just walk around daydreaming. The daydreaming has to be interleaved with deliberate work that feeds it questions.

\[[10](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f10n)\]  

不过，你必须以正常的方式努力工作，才能从这种现象中受益。你不能只是走来走去做白日梦。做白日梦必须与刻意的工作交织在一起，为它提供问题。\[10\]

Everyone knows to avoid distractions at work, but it's also important to avoid them in the other half of the cycle. When you let your mind wander, it wanders to whatever you care about most at that moment. So avoid the kind of distraction that pushes your work out of the top spot, or you'll waste this valuable type of thinking on the distraction instead. (Exception: Don't avoid love.)

  

每个人都知道在工作中要避免分心，但在周期的另一半中避免分心也很重要。当你让你的思想游荡时，它就会游荡到你在那一刻最关心的事情上。所以要避免那种把你的工作推到首要位置的分心，否则你就会把这种宝贵的思考方式反而浪费在分心上。(例外：不要避开爱情。）

Consciously cultivate your taste in the work done in your field. Until you know which is the best and what makes it so, you don't know what you're aiming for.

  

有意识地培养你对你所在领域的工作的品味。在你知道哪个是最好的，是什么让它如此，你就不知道你的目标是什么。

And that _is_ what you're aiming for, because if you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good. This observation has been made by so many people in so many different fields that it might be worth thinking about why it's true. It could be because ambition is a phenomenon where almost all the error is in one direction — where almost all the shells that miss the target miss by falling short. Or it could be because ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. Or maybe being good is simply too vague a standard. Probably all three are true.

\[[11](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f11n)\]  

而这正是你的目标，因为如果你不努力成为最好的，你甚至不会成为好的。在许多不同的领域，许多人都提出了这一看法，也许值得思考一下为什么它是真的。这可能是因为野心是一种几乎所有的错误都在一个方向上的现象--几乎所有错过目标的炮弹都是因为落空。或者可能是因为成为最好的野心与成为好的野心在质量上是不同的。或者也许 "好 "只是一个太模糊的标准。可能这三种情况都是真的。\[11\]

Fortunately there's a kind of economy of scale here. Though it might seem like you'd be taking on a heavy burden by trying to be the best, in practice you often end up net ahead. It's exciting, and also strangely liberating. It simplifies things. In some ways it's easier to try to be the best than to try merely to be good.

  

幸运的是，这里有一种规模经济。虽然看起来你会因为试图成为最好的而承担沉重的负担，但在实践中，你往往最终会净身出户。这是令人兴奋的，也是奇怪的解放。它简化了事情。在某些方面，努力成为最好的比仅仅努力成为好的更容易。

One way to aim high is to try to make something that people will care about in a hundred years. Not because their opinions matter more than your contemporaries', but because something that still seems good in a hundred years is more likely to be genuinely good.

  

目标高的一个方法是尝试做一些百年后人们会关心的东西。不是因为他们的意见比你同时代的人更重要，而是因为100年后看起来仍然不错的东西更有可能是真正的好东西。

Don't try to work in a distinctive style. Just try to do the best job you can; you won't be able to help doing it in a distinctive way.

  

不要试图以一种独特的风格来工作。只需努力做好你能做的工作；你不可能不以独特的方式来完成它。

Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying to is affectation.

  

风格是以一种独特的方式做事，而不是试图这样做。试图这样做是一种影响。

Affectation is in effect to pretend that someone other than you is doing the work. You adopt an impressive but fake persona, and while you're pleased with the impressiveness, the fakeness is what shows in the work.

\[[12](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f12n)\]  

装腔作势实际上是假装你以外的人在做这项工作。你采用一个令人印象深刻但虚假的角色，虽然你对这种印象深刻感到高兴，但这种虚假性在工作中表现出来。\[12\]

The temptation to be someone else is greatest for the young. They often feel like nobodies. But you never need to worry about that problem, because it's self-solving if you work on sufficiently ambitious projects. If you succeed at an ambitious project, you're not a nobody; you're the person who did it. So just do the work and your identity will take care of itself.

  

成为别人的诱惑对年轻人来说是最大的。他们经常觉得自己是无名小卒。但你永远不需要担心这个问题，因为如果你从事足够雄心勃勃的项目，这个问题就会自我解决。如果你在一个雄心勃勃的项目上取得成功，你就不是一个无名小卒；你就是那个做这个项目的人。所以只要做工作，你的身份就会自己解决。

"Avoid affectation" is a useful rule so far as it goes, but how would you express this idea positively? How would you say what to be, instead of what not to be? The best answer is earnest. If you're earnest you avoid not just affectation but a whole set of similar vices.

  

"避免装腔作势 "是一个有用的规则，但你如何积极地表达这个想法？你如何说要做什么，而不是不要做什么？最好的答案是认真。如果你是认真的，你不仅要避免感情用事，还要避免一整套类似的恶习。

The core of being earnest is being intellectually honest. We're taught as children to be honest as an unselfish virtue — as a kind of sacrifice. But in fact it's a source of power too. To see new ideas, you need an exceptionally sharp eye for the truth. You're trying to see more truth than others have seen so far. And how can you have a sharp eye for the truth if you're intellectually dishonest?

  

认真的核心是智力上的诚实。我们从小就被教导要把诚实作为一种无私的美德--作为一种牺牲。但事实上，它也是一种力量的源泉。要看到新的想法，你需要有一双对真理异常敏锐的眼睛。你要看到比别人迄今为止所看到的更多的真相。如果你在智力上不诚实，你怎么能有一双敏锐的眼睛来观察真相呢？

One way to avoid intellectual dishonesty is to maintain a slight positive pressure in the opposite direction. Be aggressively willing to admit that you're mistaken. Once you've admitted you were mistaken about something, you're free. Till then you have to carry it.

\[[13](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f13n)\]  

避免智力不诚实的一个方法是在相反的方向保持轻微的积极压力。要积极地愿意承认你的错误。一旦你承认你在某件事上犯了错误，你就自由了。在那之前，你必须带着它。\[13\]

Another more subtle component of earnestness is informality. Informality is much more important than its grammatically negative name implies. It's not merely the absence of something. It means focusing on what matters instead of what doesn't.

  

真诚的另一个更微妙的组成部分是非正式性。非正式性比其语法上的负面名称所暗示的要重要得多。它不仅仅是没有什么东西。它意味着专注于重要的东西而不是不重要的东西。

What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you're trying to seem a certain way as you're doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That's one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that's basically the definition of a nerd.

  

形式和影响的共同点是，在做工作的同时，你试图在做工作时看起来有某种方式。但是，任何投入到你看起来如何的能量都是来自于你的优秀。这就是书呆子在做伟大的工作方面有优势的原因之一：他们很少花精力去表现什么。事实上，这基本上就是书呆子的定义。

Nerds have a kind of innocent boldness that's exactly what you need in doing great work. It's not learned; it's preserved from childhood. So hold onto it. Be the one who puts things out there rather than the one who sits back and offers sophisticated-sounding criticisms of them. "It's easy to criticize" is true in the most literal sense, and the route to great work is never easy.

  

书呆子有一种天真的胆量，这正是你在做伟大工作时需要的。它不是学来的；它是从童年时期保存下来的。所以要抓住它。做一个把事情摆出来的人，而不是一个坐在后面对它们提出听起来很复杂的批评的人。"批评是很容易的"，这句话从字面上看是对的，而通往伟大工作的道路从来都不是容易的。

There may be some jobs where it's an advantage to be cynical and pessimistic, but if you want to do great work it's an advantage to be optimistic, even though that means you'll risk looking like a fool sometimes. There's an old tradition of doing the opposite. The Old Testament says it's better to keep quiet lest you look like a fool. But that's advice for _seeming_ smart. If you actually want to discover new things, it's better to take the risk of telling people your ideas.

  

也许在有些工作中，愤世嫉俗和悲观是一种优势，但如果你想做伟大的工作，乐观是一种优势，尽管这意味着你有时会冒着看起来像个傻瓜的风险。有一个古老的传统是做相反的事情。旧约》中说，最好保持沉默，以免你看起来像个傻瓜。但那是对看起来很聪明的建议。如果你真的想发现新事物，最好是冒着风险告诉人们你的想法。

Some people are naturally earnest, and with others it takes a conscious effort. Either kind of earnestness will suffice. But I doubt it would be possible to do great work without being earnest. It's so hard to do even if you are. You don't have enough margin for error to accommodate the distortions introduced by being affected, intellectually dishonest, orthodox, fashionable, or cool.

\[[14](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f14n)\]  

有些人天生就很认真，而有些人则需要有意识的努力。无论哪种认真都足够了。但我怀疑，如果不认真的话，就不可能做伟大的工作。即使你是认真的，也很难做到。你没有足够的错误余地来适应受影响的、智力上不诚实的、正统的、时尚的或酷的所带来的扭曲。\[14\]

Great work is consistent not only with who did it, but with itself. It's usually all of a piece. So if you face a decision in the middle of working on something, ask which choice is more consistent.

  

伟大的工作不仅与谁做的一致，而且与它本身一致。它通常都是一个整体。因此，如果你在工作中面临一个决定，问问哪种选择更一致。

You may have to throw things away and redo them. You won't necessarily have to, but you have to be willing to. And that can take some effort; when there's something you need to redo, status quo bias and laziness will combine to keep you in denial about it. To beat this ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?

  

你可能不得不把东西扔掉，重新做。你不一定要这样做，但你必须愿意这样做。这可能需要一些努力；当你需要重做一些事情时，维持现状的偏见和懒惰会结合起来，使你对它持否定态度。为了克服这个问题，请问：如果我已经做了改变，我还想恢复到现在的状态吗？

Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.

  

要有裁剪的信心。不要因为你感到骄傲，或因为它花费了你很多精力，就保留不合适的东西。

Indeed, in some kinds of work it's good to strip whatever you're doing to its essence. The result will be more concentrated; you'll understand it better; and you won't be able to lie to yourself about whether there's anything real there.

  

事实上，在某些工作中，把你正在做的事情剥离到其本质是很好的。结果会更加集中；你会更好地理解它；而且你将无法在那里是否有任何真实的东西上欺骗自己。

Mathematical elegance may sound like a mere metaphor, drawn from the arts. That's what I thought when I first heard the term "elegant" applied to a proof. But now I suspect it's conceptually prior — that the main ingredient in artistic elegance is mathematical elegance. At any rate it's a useful standard well beyond math.

  

数学上的优雅可能听起来只是一个比喻，来自艺术。当我第一次听到 "优雅 "一词应用于证明时，我就是这么想的。但现在我怀疑它在概念上更重要--艺术上的优雅的主要成分是数学上的优雅。无论如何，它是一个有用的标准，远远超出了数学。

Elegance can be a long-term bet, though. Laborious solutions will often have more prestige in the short term. They cost a lot of effort and they're hard to understand, both of which impress people, at least temporarily.

  

不过，优雅可以是一个长期的赌注。费力的解决方案往往在短期内会有更多的声望。它们花费了大量的精力，而且难以理解，这两点都会给人留下深刻印象，至少是暂时的。

Whereas some of the very best work will seem like it took comparatively little effort, because it was in a sense already there. It didn't have to be built, just seen. It's a very good sign when it's hard to say whether you're creating something or discovering it.

  

而一些非常好的作品看起来花费的精力相对较少，因为它在某种意义上已经存在。它不需要被建造，只是被看到。如果很难说你是在创造什么，还是在发现什么，这就是一个非常好的迹象。

When you're doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape.

  

当你做的工作可以被看作是创造或发现时，请站在发现的一边。试着把自己看作是一个单纯的管道，通过这个管道，想法会自然形成。

(Strangely enough, one exception is the problem of choosing a problem to work on. This is usually seen as search, but in the best case it's more like creating something. In the best case you create the field in the process of exploring it.)

  

(奇怪的是，有一个例外是选择一个问题来工作的问题。这通常被看作是搜索，但在最好的情况下，它更像是创造东西。在最好的情况下，你在探索的过程中创造了这个领域）。

Similarly, if you're trying to build a powerful tool, make it gratuitously unrestrictive. A powerful tool almost by definition will be used in ways you didn't expect, so err on the side of eliminating restrictions, even if you don't know what the benefit will be.

  

同样地，如果你想建立一个强大的工具，就应该让它无偿地不受限制。一个强大的工具几乎顾名思义会以你意想不到的方式被使用，所以，即使你不知道会有什么好处，也要站在消除限制的一边。

Great work will often be tool-like in the sense of being something others build on. So it's a good sign if you're creating ideas that others could use, or exposing questions that others could answer. The best ideas have implications in many different areas.

  

伟大的工作往往是类似于工具的，即成为别人的基础。因此，如果你创造了别人可以使用的想法，或者暴露了别人可以回答的问题，这是个好兆头。最好的想法在许多不同领域都有影响。

If you express your ideas in the most general form, they'll be truer than you intended.

  

如果你以最一般的形式表达你的想法，它们会比你的意图更真实。

True by itself is not enough, of course. Great ideas have to be true and new. And it takes a certain amount of ability to see new ideas even once you've learned enough to get to one of the frontiers of knowledge.

  

当然，仅仅是真实本身是不够的。伟大的想法必须是真实和新的。而且，即使你已经学到了足够的知识，达到了知识的前沿之一，也需要一定的能力来看到新的想法。

In English we give this ability names like originality, creativity, and imagination. And it seems reasonable to give it a separate name, because it does seem to some extent a separate skill. It's possible to have a great deal of ability in other respects — to have a great deal of what's often called "technical ability" — and yet not have much of this.

  

在英语中，我们给这种能力起了一些名字，如原创力、创造力和想象力。而给它一个单独的名字似乎是合理的，因为它在某种程度上似乎是一种独立的技能。有可能在其他方面拥有大量的能力--拥有大量的通常被称为 "技术能力 "的能力--但却没有多少这种能力。

I've never liked the term "creative process." It seems misleading. Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind. Original thinkers throw off new ideas about whatever they focus on, like an angle grinder throwing off sparks. They can't help it.

  

我一直不喜欢 "创作过程 "这个词。它似乎有误导性。原创性不是一个过程，而是一种思维习惯。原创性思维者对他们所关注的任何事物都会产生新的想法，就像角磨机产生的火花。他们不能不这样做。

If the thing they're focused on is something they don't understand very well, these new ideas might not be good. One of the most original thinkers I know decided to focus on dating after he got divorced. He knew roughly as much about dating as the average 15 year old, and the results were spectacularly colorful. But to see originality separated from expertise like that made its nature all the more clear.

  

如果他们关注的事情是他们不太了解的事情，这些新的想法可能并不好。我认识的一个最有创意的思想家在离婚后决定专注于约会。他对约会的了解大概和一般15岁的孩子一样多，而结果是惊人的丰富多彩。但看到原创性与专业知识如此分离，其本质就更加清晰了。

I don't know if it's possible to cultivate originality, but there are definitely ways to make the most of however much you have. For example, you're much more likely to have original ideas when you're working on something. Original ideas don't come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult.

\[[15](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f15n)\]  

我不知道是否有可能培养出原创性，但肯定有办法使你拥有的东西得到充分利用。例如，当你在工作时，你更有可能有原创的想法。原创的想法并不是来自于试图拥有原创的想法。它们来自于试图建立或理解一些稍显困难的东西。\[15\]

Talking or writing about the things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there's a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing.

  

谈论或书写你感兴趣的事情是产生新想法的好方法。当你试图把想法写成文字时，一个缺失的想法会产生一种真空，把它从你身上吸引出来。的确，有一种思考只能通过写作来完成。

Changing your context can help. If you visit a new place, you'll often find you have new ideas there. The journey itself often dislodges them. But you may not have to go far to get this benefit. Sometimes it's enough just to go for a walk.

\[[16](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f16n)\]  

改变你的环境可以帮助你。如果你去一个新的地方，你会经常发现你在那里有新的想法。旅程本身常常使它们移位。但你可能不必走远就能得到这种好处。有时只需去走走就足够了。\[16\]

It also helps to travel in topic space. You'll have more new ideas if you explore lots of different topics, partly because it gives the angle grinder more surface area to work on, and partly because analogies are an especially fruitful source of new ideas.

  

这也有助于在主题空间中旅行。如果你探索很多不同的主题，你会有更多的新想法，部分原因是它给了角磨机更多的工作表面，部分原因是类比是新想法的一个特别富有成效的来源。

Don't divide your attention _evenly_ between many topics though, or you'll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law.

\[[17](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f17n)\] Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.  

不过，不要把你的注意力平均分配给许多主题，否则你会把自己的注意力分散得太厉害。你要根据类似幂律的东西来分配注意力。\[17\] 对几个主题有专业的好奇心，对更多的主题有闲置的好奇心。

Curiosity and originality are closely related. Curiosity feeds originality by giving it new things to work on. But the relationship is closer than that. Curiosity is itself a kind of originality; it's roughly to questions what originality is to answers. And since questions at their best are a big component of answers, curiosity at its best is a creative force.

  

好奇心和原创性是密切相关的。好奇心通过给它提供新的东西来养活原创力。但两者的关系比这更密切。好奇心本身就是一种原创性；它对问题的意义大致相当于原创性对答案的意义。由于问题在其最佳状态下是答案的一个重要组成部分，好奇心在其最佳状态下是一种创造性的力量。

Having new ideas is a strange game, because it usually consists of seeing things that were right under your nose. Once you've seen a new idea, it tends to seem obvious. Why did no one think of this before?

  

有新的想法是一个奇怪的游戏，因为它通常包括看到那些在你眼皮底下的东西。一旦你看到一个新的想法，它往往看起来很明显。为什么以前没有人想到这个？

When an idea seems simultaneously novel and obvious, it's probably a good one.

  

当一个想法看起来既新颖又明显时，它可能是一个好想法。

Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What's the source of this apparent contradiction? It's that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That's how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they're easy to see after you do something hard.

  

看到明显的东西听起来很容易。而根据经验有新的想法却很难。这种明显矛盾的根源是什么？这是因为看到新的想法通常需要你改变你看世界的方式。我们通过既能帮助我们又能制约我们的模型来看世界。当你修复一个破碎的模型时，新的想法就会变得明显。但注意到并修复一个破碎的模型是很难的。这就是新想法如何既明显又难以发现的原因：在你做了一些困难的事情之后，它们很容易被发现。

One way to discover broken models is to be stricter than other people. Broken models of the world leave a trail of clues where they bash against reality. Most people don't want to see these clues. It would be an understatement to say that they're attached to their current model; it's what they think in; so they'll tend to ignore the trail of clues left by its breakage, however conspicuous it may seem in retrospect.

  

发现破碎模型的一个方法是比其他人更严格。破碎的世界模型在它们与现实撞击的地方留下了线索。大多数人不愿意看到这些线索。说他们依附于他们目前的模型是轻描淡写的；那是他们的思维方式；所以他们会倾向于忽略模型破损后留下的线索，不管它在回想起来多么显眼。

To find new ideas you have to seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away. That's what Einstein did. He was able to see the wild implications of Maxwell's equations not so much because he was looking for new ideas as because he was stricter.

  

要找到新的想法，你必须抓住破损的迹象，而不是视而不见。这就是爱因斯坦所做的。他能够看到麦克斯韦方程的疯狂影响，并不是因为他在寻找新的想法，而是因为他更严格。

The other thing you need is a willingness to break rules. Paradoxical as it sounds, if you want to fix your model of the world, it helps to be the sort of person who's comfortable breaking rules. From the point of view of the old model, which everyone including you initially shares, the new model usually breaks at least implicit rules.

  

你需要的另一件事是愿意打破规则。虽然听起来很矛盾，但如果你想修复你的世界模型，那么成为那种愿意打破规则的人是有帮助的。从包括你在内的所有人最初都认同的旧模式的角度来看，新模式通常至少会打破隐含的规则。

Few understand the degree of rule-breaking required, because new ideas seem much more conservative once they succeed. They seem perfectly reasonable once you're using the new model of the world they brought with them. But they didn't at the time; it took the greater part of a century for the heliocentric model to be generally accepted, even among astronomers, because it felt so wrong.

  

很少有人理解需要打破规则的程度，因为新的想法一旦成功就显得保守得多。一旦你使用他们带来的新的世界模型，他们似乎完全合理。但他们当时没有；日心模式花了一个世纪的大部分时间才被普遍接受，甚至在天文学家中也是如此，因为它感觉如此错误。

Indeed, if you think about it, a good new idea has to seem bad to most people, or someone would have already explored it. So what you're looking for is ideas that seem crazy, but the right kind of crazy. How do you recognize these? You can't with certainty. Often ideas that seem bad are bad. But ideas that are the right kind of crazy tend to be exciting; they're rich in implications; whereas ideas that are merely bad tend to be depressing.

  

事实上，如果你想一想，一个好的新想法对大多数人来说必须是坏的，否则有人已经在探索它了。因此，你要寻找的是那些看起来很疯狂的想法，但又是正确的那种疯狂。你如何识别这些？你不能确定。通常情况下，看起来不好的想法是不好的。但是正确的疯狂的想法往往是令人兴奋的；它们有丰富的含义；而仅仅是坏的想法往往是令人沮丧的。

There are two ways to be comfortable breaking rules: to enjoy breaking them, and to be indifferent to them. I call these two cases being aggressively and passively independent-minded.

  

有两种方式可以让人舒服地打破规则：喜欢打破规则，以及对规则漠不关心。我把这两种情况称为积极和消极的独立意识。

The aggressively independent-minded are the naughty ones. Rules don't merely fail to stop them; breaking rules gives them additional energy. For this sort of person, delight at the sheer audacity of a project sometimes supplies enough activation energy to get it started.

  

思想积极独立的人是淘气的人。规则不仅不能阻止他们，打破规则还会给他们带来额外的能量。对这种人来说，对一个项目的纯粹大胆性感到高兴，有时会提供足够的激活能量，让它开始。

The other way to break rules is not to care about them, or perhaps even to know they exist. This is why novices and outsiders often make new discoveries; their ignorance of a field's assumptions acts as a source of temporary passive independent-mindedness. Aspies also seem to have a kind of immunity to conventional beliefs. Several I know say that this helps them to have new ideas.

  

打破规则的另一种方式是不关心它们，或许甚至不知道它们的存在。这就是为什么新手和局外人经常会有新的发现；他们对一个领域的假设的无知，成为暂时的被动独立思想的来源。阿斯比人似乎对传统信仰也有一种免疫力。我认识的几个人说，这有助于他们有新的想法。

Strictness plus rule-breaking sounds like a strange combination. In popular culture they're opposed. But popular culture has a broken model in this respect. It implicitly assumes that issues are trivial ones, and in trivial matters strictness and rule-breaking _are_ opposed. But in questions that really matter, only rule-breakers can be truly strict.

  

严格加破坏规则听起来是一个奇怪的组合。在流行文化中，它们是对立的。但流行文化在这方面有一个破碎的模式。它隐含地假设问题是微不足道的，而在微不足道的问题上，严格和破坏规则是对立的。但在真正重要的问题上，只有破坏规则的人才能真正严格。

An overlooked idea often doesn't lose till the semifinals. You do see it, subconsciously, but then another part of your subconscious shoots it down because it would be too weird, too risky, too much work, too controversial. This suggests an exciting possibility: if you could turn off such filters, you could see more new ideas.

  

一个被忽视的想法往往要到半决赛才会输。你确实看到了它，在潜意识中，但你潜意识的另一部分却把它拍了下来，因为它太奇怪，太冒险，太费劲，太有争议。这表明了一种令人兴奋的可能性：如果你能关闭这种过滤器，你就能看到更多的新想法。

One way to do that is to ask what would be good ideas for _someone else_ to explore. Then your subconscious won't shoot them down to protect you.

  

做到这一点的一个方法是询问什么是别人可以探索的好主意。这样你的潜意识就不会为了保护你而把它们击落。

You could also discover overlooked ideas by working in the other direction: by starting from what's obscuring them. Every cherished but mistaken principle is surrounded by a dead zone of valuable ideas that are unexplored because they contradict it.

  

你也可以通过另一个方向来发现被忽视的想法：从遮蔽它们的东西开始。每一个被珍视但错误的原则都被一个有价值的想法的死角所包围，这些想法之所以没有被发掘，是因为它们与它相矛盾。

Religions are collections of cherished but mistaken principles. So anything that can be described either literally or metaphorically as a religion will have valuable unexplored ideas in its shadow. Copernicus and Darwin both made discoveries of this type.

\[[18](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f18n)\]  

宗教是珍惜但错误的原则的集合。因此，任何可以从字面上或隐喻上被描述为宗教的东西，都会在其阴影下有宝贵的未被探索的思想。哥白尼和达尔文都有这种类型的发现。\[18\]

What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it?

  

在你的领域里，人们对什么是有宗教信仰的，即过于执着于一些可能并不像他们所想的那样不言自明的原则？如果你摒弃它，什么会成为可能？

People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who'd never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems.

  

人们在解决问题时表现出的独创性比决定解决哪些问题时要多得多。即使是最聪明的人在决定做什么工作时也会出奇的保守。那些从未梦想过以其他方式成为时尚的人，却被吸进了时尚问题的工作中。

One reason people are more conservative when choosing problems than solutions is that problems are bigger bets. A problem could occupy you for years, while exploring a solution might only take days. But even so I think most people are too conservative. They're not merely responding to risk, but to fashion as well. Unfashionable problems are undervalued.

  

人们在选择问题时比选择解决方案时更保守的一个原因是，问题是更大的赌注。一个问题可能占据你几年的时间，而探索一个解决方案可能只需要几天。但即便如此，我认为大多数人还是太保守了。他们不仅仅是对风险做出反应，也是对时尚做出反应。不合时宜的问题被低估了。

One of the most interesting kinds of unfashionable problem is the problem that people think has been fully explored, but hasn't. Great work often takes something that already exists and shows its latent potential. Durer and Watt both did this. So if you're interested in a field that others think is tapped out, don't let their skepticism deter you. People are often wrong about this.

  

最有趣的一种不合时宜的问题是人们认为已经被充分探索的问题，但还没有。伟大的作品往往采用已经存在的东西并展示其潜在的潜力。杜勒和瓦特都做到了这一点。因此，如果你对一个别人认为已经被挖掘出来的领域感兴趣，不要让他们的怀疑态度吓倒你。人们在这方面往往是错误的。

Working on an unfashionable problem can be very pleasing. There's no hype or hurry. Opportunists and critics are both occupied elsewhere. The existing work often has an old-school solidity. And there's a satisfying sense of economy in cultivating ideas that would otherwise be wasted.

  

在一个不合时宜的问题上工作，可以是非常令人高兴的。没有炒作或匆忙。机会主义者和批评家都在其他地方忙碌。现有的工作往往有一种老派的稳固性。而且，在培养那些否则会被浪费的想法时，有一种令人满意的经济感。

But the most common type of overlooked problem is not explicitly unfashionable in the sense of being out of fashion. It just doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does. How do you find these? By being self-indulgent — by letting your curiosity have its way, and tuning out, at least temporarily, the little voice in your head that says you should only be working on "important" problems.

  

但是，最常见的一类被忽视的问题并不是明确的不时髦，即不符合时尚。它只是看起来不那么重要，而实际上却很重要。你如何找到这些？通过自我放纵--让你的好奇心得到满足，并至少暂时避开你头脑中那个说你应该只处理 "重要 "问题的小声音。

You do need to work on important problems, but almost everyone is too conservative about what counts as one. And if there's an important but overlooked problem in your neighborhood, it's probably already on your subconscious radar screen. So try asking yourself: if you were going to take a break from "serious" work to work on something just because it would be really interesting, what would you do? The answer is probably more important than it seems.

  

你确实需要解决重要的问题，但几乎每个人都对什么是重要问题过于保守。如果你周围有一个重要的但被忽视的问题，它可能已经在你的潜意识的雷达屏幕上。因此，试着问自己：如果你要从 "严肃 "的工作中抽身出来，去做一件事，只是因为它真的很有趣，你会做什么？答案可能比它看起来更重要。

Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That's what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game.

  

选择问题的原创性似乎比解决问题的原创性更重要。这就是那些发现全新领域的人的区别。因此，在某种意义上，看似只是最初的步骤--决定研究什么--却是整个游戏的关键。

Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question.

  

很少有人能把握住这一点。关于新思想的最大误解之一是关于其构成中问题与答案的比例。人们认为大思想是答案，但往往真正的洞察力是在问题中。

Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise? Is the force that makes objects fall to earth the same as the one that keeps planets in their orbits? By even asking such questions you were already in excitingly novel territory.

  

我们低估问题的部分原因是它们在学校的使用方式。在学校里，它们往往只在被回答之前短暂地存在，就像不稳定的粒子。但是，一个真正的好问题可以远不止于此。一个真正的好问题是一个部分的发现。新物种是如何产生的？使物体落到地球上的力与使行星保持在其轨道上的力是一样的吗？甚至提出这样的问题，你就已经在令人激动的新领域了。

Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.

  

未回答的问题可能是让人不舒服的东西，要带在身边。但是你带的越多，注意到解决方案的机会就越大--或者也许更令人兴奋的是，注意到两个未回答的问题是一样的。

Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive.

\[[19](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f19n)\]  

有时你会带着一个问题走很久。伟大的工作往往来自于回到你多年前--甚至在你的童年--第一次注意到的问题，并且无法停止思考。人们经常谈论保持年轻时梦想的重要性，但保持年轻时的问题也同样重要。\[19\]

This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either.

  

这是实际的专业知识与流行的图片最不同的地方之一。在流行的图片中，专家是确定的。但实际上，你越困惑越好，只要(a)你困惑的事情很重要，(b)其他人也不了解这些。

Think about what's happening at the moment just before a new idea is discovered. Often someone with sufficient expertise is puzzled about something. Which means that originality consists partly of puzzlement — of confusion! You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.

\[[20](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f20n)\]  

想一想，就在一个新想法被发现之前，此刻发生了什么。通常情况下，有足够专业知识的人对某件事情感到困惑。这意味着原创性部分是由困惑组成的--困惑!你必须对这个充满困惑的世界感到舒服，以至于你愿意看到它们，但不能舒服到不想去解决它们。\[20\]

It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.

  

在未回答的问题中致富是一件伟大的事情。而这是富者愈富的情况之一，因为获得新问题的最好方法是尝试回答现有问题。问题不仅会导致答案，也会导致更多的问题。

The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.

  

最好的问题是在回答中成长。你注意到一条从当前范式中突出的线，并尝试拉动它，它就会变得越来越长。因此，在你尝试回答一个问题之前，不要要求它明显很大。你很少能预测到这一点。即使是注意到这根线也很难，更不用说预测如果你拉住它，会有多少东西被解开。

It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.

  

最好是滥发好奇心--在很多条线上拉一点，看看会发生什么。大事从小事开始。大事情的最初版本往往只是实验，或副业，或会谈，然后发展成更大的事情。所以要开始做很多小事情。

Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones.

\[[21](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f21n)\]  

多产是被低估的。你尝试的不同事情越多，发现新东西的机会就越大。但是，要明白，尝试大量的事情将意味着尝试大量不成功的事情。你不可能有很多好的想法而没有很多坏的想法。\[21\]

Though it sounds more responsible to begin by studying everything that's been done before, you'll learn faster and have more fun by trying stuff. And you'll understand previous work better when you do look at it. So err on the side of starting. Which is easier when starting means starting small; those two ideas fit together like two puzzle pieces.

  

虽然从研究以前做过的一切开始听起来更有责任感，但通过尝试，你会学得更快，更有乐趣。而且当你看了以前的作品后，你会更好地理解它。因此，请站在开始的一边。当开始意味着从小事做起时，这就更容易了；这两个想法就像两块拼图一样合在一起。

How do you get from starting small to doing something great? By making successive versions. Great things are almost always made in successive versions. You start with something small and evolve it, and the final version is both cleverer and more ambitious than anything you could have planned.

  

你如何从小事做起，做出一番大事业？通过制作连续的版本。伟大的事情几乎总是在连续的版本中完成。你从小事做起，不断发展，最终的版本比你计划的任何事情都更聪明，更有雄心。

It's particularly useful to make successive versions when you're making something for people — to get an initial version in front of them quickly, and then evolve it based on their response.

  

当你为人们制作东西时，连续制作版本是特别有用的--迅速在他们面前得到一个最初的版本，然后根据他们的反应来发展它。

Begin by trying the simplest thing that could possibly work. Surprisingly often, it does. If it doesn't, this will at least get you started.

  

从尝试最简单的事情开始，这可能是有效的。令人惊讶的是，它往往会起作用。如果不成功，这至少可以让你开始。

Don't try to cram too much new stuff into any one version. There are names for doing this with the first version (taking too long to ship) and the second (the second system effect), but these are both merely instances of a more general principle.

  

不要试图把太多的新东西塞进任何一个版本。第一个版本和第二个版本都有这样做的名称（花了太多时间出货），但这些都只是一个更普遍的原则的实例。

An early version of a new project will sometimes be dismissed as a toy. It's a good sign when people do this. That means it has everything a new idea needs except scale, and that tends to follow.

\[[22](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f22n)\]  

一个新项目的早期版本有时会被视为玩具而被驳回。当人们这样做时，这是一个好兆头。这意味着它拥有一个新想法所需要的一切，除了规模，而这往往会随之而来。\[22\]

The alternative to starting with something small and evolving it is to plan in advance what you're going to do. And planning does usually seem the more responsible choice. It sounds more organized to say "we're going to do x and then y and then z" than "we're going to try x and see what happens." And it is more _organized_; it just doesn't work as well.

  

从小事做起并不断发展的另一种方法是提前计划你要做的事情。而计划通常看起来是更负责任的选择。说 "我们要做X，然后Y，然后Z "比说 "我们要尝试X，看看会发生什么 "听起来更有条理。而且它更有条理；它只是没有那么好的效果。

Planning per se isn't good. It's sometimes necessary, but it's a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It's something you have to do because you're working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. If you keep projects small and use flexible media, you don't have to plan as much, and your designs can evolve instead.

  

规划本身并不是好事。它有时是必要的，但它是一种必要的邪恶--对无情的条件的反应。这是你必须做的事情，因为你正在使用不灵活的媒体，或者因为你需要协调很多人的努力。如果你保持项目的规模并使用灵活的媒体，你就不需要做那么多的计划，你的设计反而可以不断发展。

Take as much risk as you can afford. In an efficient market, risk is proportionate to reward, so don't look for certainty, but for a bet with high expected value. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative.

  

在你能承受的范围内承担尽可能多的风险。在一个有效的市场中，风险与回报是成正比的，所以不要寻求确定性，而是寻求具有高预期价值的赌注。如果你偶尔没有失败，你可能是太保守了。

Though conservatism is usually associated with the old, it's the young who tend to make this mistake. Inexperience makes them fear risk, but it's when you're young that you can afford the most.

  

虽然保守主义通常与老年人有关，但往往是年轻人犯这种错误。经验不足使他们害怕风险，但当你年轻的时候，你可以负担最多。

Even a project that fails can be valuable. In the process of working on it, you'll have crossed territory few others have seen, and encountered questions few others have asked. And there's probably no better source of questions than the ones you encounter in trying to do something slightly too hard.

  

即使是一个失败的项目也是有价值的。在工作的过程中，你会越过很少有人见过的领域，遇到很少有人问过的问题。可能没有什么问题比你在尝试做一些略微太难的事情时遇到的问题更有价值了。

Use the advantages of youth when you have them, and the advantages of age once you have those. The advantages of youth are energy, time, optimism, and freedom. The advantages of age are knowledge, efficiency, money, and power. With effort you can acquire some of the latter when young and keep some of the former when old.

  

当你拥有年轻的优势时，要利用这些优势，一旦你拥有这些优势，就要利用年龄的优势。年轻的优势是精力、时间、乐观和自由。年龄的优势是知识、效率、金钱和权力。通过努力，你可以在年轻时获得一些后者，在年老时保持一些前者。

The old also have the advantage of knowing which advantages they have. The young often have them without realizing it. The biggest is probably time. The young have no idea how rich they are in time. The best way to turn this time to advantage is to use it in slightly frivolous ways: to learn about something you don't need to know about, just out of curiosity, or to try building something just because it would be cool, or to become freakishly good at something.

  

老人也有优势，知道他们有哪些优势。年轻人往往在不知不觉中拥有这些优势。最大的优势可能是时间。年轻人不知道他们在时间上有多富裕。将时间转化为优势的最好方法是以略微轻浮的方式使用它：学习一些你不需要知道的东西，只是出于好奇，或尝试建造一些东西，只是因为这很酷，或在某些方面变得异常优秀。

That "slightly" is an important qualification. Spend time lavishly when you're young, but don't simply waste it. There's a big difference between doing something you worry might be a waste of time and doing something you know for sure will be. The former is at least a bet, and possibly a better one than you think.

\[[23](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f23n)\]  

这个 "略 "是一个重要的条件。在你年轻的时候，花点时间吧，但不要简单地浪费它。在做你担心可能会浪费时间的事情和做你知道肯定会浪费时间的事情之间有很大区别。前者至少是一个赌注，而且可能比你想象的更好。\[23\]

The most subtle advantage of youth, or more precisely of inexperience, is that you're seeing everything with fresh eyes. When your brain embraces an idea for the first time, sometimes the two don't fit together perfectly. Usually the problem is with your brain, but occasionally it's with the idea. A piece of it sticks out awkwardly and jabs you when you think about it. People who are used to the idea have learned to ignore it, but you have the opportunity not to.

\[[24](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f24n)\]  

年轻的最微妙的优势，或者更准确地说是没有经验的优势，就是你用新的眼光看待一切。当你的大脑第一次接受一个想法时，有时两者并不完全吻合。通常，问题出在你的大脑上，但偶尔也会出在想法上。当你想到它的时候，它的某个部分就会尴尬地伸出来，刺伤你。习惯于这个想法的人已经学会忽略它，但你有机会不这样做。\[24\]

So when you're learning about something for the first time, pay attention to things that seem wrong or missing. You'll be tempted to ignore them, since there's a 99% chance the problem is with you. And you may have to set aside your misgivings temporarily to keep progressing. But don't forget about them. When you've gotten further into the subject, come back and check if they're still there. If they're still viable in the light of your present knowledge, they probably represent an undiscovered idea.

  

因此，当你第一次学习一些东西时，要注意那些看起来不对或缺失的东西。你会很想忽略它们，因为有99%的机会问题出在你身上。你可能不得不暂时搁置你的疑虑，以保持进步。但是不要忘记它们。当你对这个问题有了进一步的了解，再回来看看它们是否还在。如果根据你目前的知识，它们仍然是可行的，它们可能代表了一个未被发现的想法。

One of the most valuable kinds of knowledge you get from experience is to know what you _don't_ have to worry about. The young know all the things that could matter, but not their relative importance. So they worry equally about everything, when they should worry much more about a few things and hardly at all about the rest.

  

你从经验中得到的最有价值的一种知识是知道你不必担心什么。年轻人知道所有可能重要的事情，但不知道它们的相对重要性。因此，他们对所有事情都同样担心，而他们应该对少数事情更担心，对其他事情几乎不担心。

But what you don't know is only half the problem with inexperience. The other half is what you do know that ain't so. You arrive at adulthood with your head full of nonsense — bad habits you've acquired and false things you've been taught — and you won't be able to do great work till you clear away at least the nonsense in the way of whatever type of work you want to do.

  

但你不知道的事只是没有经验的一半问题。另一半问题是你所知道的事情并非如此。你到了成年，脑子里充满了胡言乱语--你获得的坏习惯和你被教导的错误的东西--你将无法做伟大的工作，除非你至少清除妨碍你想做的任何类型工作的胡言乱语。

Much of the nonsense left in your head is left there by schools. We're so used to schools that we unconsciously treat going to school as identical with learning, but in fact schools have all sorts of strange qualities that warp our ideas about learning and thinking.

  

留在你脑子里的许多胡言乱语都是由学校留下的。我们如此习惯于学校，以至于我们不自觉地把上学与学习等同起来，但事实上，学校有各种奇怪的品质，扭曲了我们对学习和思考的想法。

For example, schools induce passivity. Since you were a small child, there was an authority at the front of the class telling all of you what you had to learn and then measuring whether you did. But neither classes nor tests are intrinsic to learning; they're just artifacts of the way schools are usually designed.

  

例如，学校会诱发被动性。从你还是个小孩子的时候起，就有一个权威在班级前面告诉你们所有人你们必须学习什么，然后衡量你们是否做到。但无论是上课还是考试都不是学习的内在因素；它们只是学校通常设计方式的人工制品。

The sooner you overcome this passivity, the better. If you're still in school, try thinking of your education as your project, and your teachers as working for you rather than vice versa. That may seem a stretch, but it's not merely some weird thought experiment. It's the truth, economically, and in the best case it's the truth intellectually as well. The best teachers don't want to be your bosses. They'd prefer it if you pushed ahead, using them as a source of advice, rather than being pulled by them through the material.

  

你越早克服这种被动性，就越好。如果你还在上学，试着把你的教育当作你的项目，把你的老师当作为你工作，而不是反过来。这可能看起来很夸张，但这不仅仅是一些奇怪的思想实验。在经济上，这是事实，在最好的情况下，这也是智力上的事实。最好的老师并不想成为你的老板。他们更希望你能向前推进，把他们作为建议的来源，而不是被他们拉着完成材料。

Schools also give you a misleading impression of what work is like. In school they tell you what the problems are, and they're almost always soluble using no more than you've been taught so far. In real life you have to figure out what the problems are, and you often don't know if they're soluble at all.

  

学校也给你一个关于工作的误导性印象。在学校里，他们告诉你问题是什么，而这些问题几乎总是可以解决的，只需要你到目前为止所学到的东西。在现实生活中，你必须弄清楚问题是什么，而且你往往不知道它们是否可以解决。

But perhaps the worst thing schools do to you is train you to win by hacking the test. You can't do great work by doing that. You can't trick God. So stop looking for that kind of shortcut. The way to beat the system is to focus on problems and solutions that others have overlooked, not to skimp on the work itself.

  

但是，学校对你做的最糟糕的事情也许是训练你通过黑掉考试而获胜。你不可能通过这样做来做伟大的工作。你不可能欺骗上帝。所以不要再寻找那种捷径了。战胜系统的方法是专注于别人忽略的问题和解决方案，而不是在工作本身上偷懒。

Don't think of yourself as dependent on some gatekeeper giving you a "big break." Even if this were true, the best way to get it would be to focus on doing good work rather than chasing influential people.

  

不要认为自己依赖于一些守门人给你的 "大突破"。即使这是真的，获得它的最好方法是专注于做好工作，而不是追逐有影响力的人。

And don't take rejection by committees to heart. The qualities that impress admissions officers and prize committees are quite different from those required to do great work. The decisions of selection committees are only meaningful to the extent that they're part of a feedback loop, and very few are.

  

也不要把委员会的拒绝放在心上。能给招生官和评奖委员会留下深刻印象的品质与完成伟大工作所需的品质是完全不同的。遴选委员会的决定只有在成为反馈循环的一部分时才有意义，但很少是这样。

People new to a field will often copy existing work. There's nothing inherently bad about that. There's no better way to learn how something works than by trying to reproduce it. Nor does copying necessarily make your work unoriginal. Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones.

  

刚进入一个领域的人往往会复制现有的工作。这本身并没有什么不好。没有比试图复制某样东西更好的方法来学习它如何工作。抄袭也不一定会使你的工作失去原创性。原创性是指有新的想法，而不是没有旧的想法。

There's a good way to copy and a bad way. If you're going to copy something, do it openly instead of furtively, or worse still, unconsciously. This is what's meant by the famously misattributed phrase "Great artists steal." The really dangerous kind of copying, the kind that gives copying a bad name, is the kind that's done without realizing it, because you're nothing more than a train running on tracks laid down by someone else. But at the other extreme, copying can be a sign of superiority rather than subordination.

\[[25](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f25n)\]  

抄袭有好的方式，也有坏的方式。如果你要抄袭某样东西，就要公开地抄袭，而不是偷偷摸摸地抄袭，或者更糟糕的是，不自觉地抄袭。这就是 "伟大的艺术家偷窃 "这句著名的错误说法的意思。真正危险的抄袭，也就是给抄袭一个坏名声的那种，是在不知不觉中完成的，因为你只不过是一列在别人铺设的轨道上运行的火车而已。但在另一个极端，抄袭可以是一种优越感而不是从属感的标志。\[25\]

In many fields it's almost inevitable that your early work will be in some sense based on other people's. Projects rarely arise in a vacuum. They're usually a reaction to previous work. When you're first starting out, you don't have any previous work; if you're going to react to something, it has to be someone else's. Once you're established, you can react to your own. But while the former gets called derivative and the latter doesn't, structurally the two cases are more similar than they seem.

  

在许多领域，几乎不可避免的是，你的早期工作将在某种意义上基于其他人的工作。项目很少在真空中出现。它们通常是对以前工作的反应。当你刚开始的时候，你没有任何以前的工作；如果你要对某些东西做出反应，那一定是别人的。一旦你建立起来，你就可以对自己的作品作出反应。但是，虽然前者被称为衍生品，后者没有，但从结构上看，这两种情况比它们看起来更相似。

Oddly enough, the very novelty of the most novel ideas sometimes makes them seem at first to be more derivative than they are. New discoveries often have to be conceived initially as variations of existing things, _even by their discoverers_, because there isn't yet the conceptual vocabulary to express them.

  

奇怪的是，最新颖的想法的新颖性有时使它们一开始看起来比它们的衍生品更多。新的发现最初往往不得不被设想为现有事物的变体，即使是它们的发现者也是如此，因为还没有概念性的词汇来表达它们。

There are definitely some dangers to copying, though. One is that you'll tend to copy old things — things that were in their day at the frontier of knowledge, but no longer are.

  

不过，抄袭肯定有一些危险。一个是你会倾向于复制旧的东西--那些在他们的时代处于知识前沿的东西，但现在已经不是了。

And when you do copy something, don't copy every feature of it. Some will make you ridiculous if you do. Don't copy the manner of an eminent 50 year old professor if you're 18, for example, or the idiom of a Renaissance poem hundreds of years later.

  

当你复制某样东西时，不要复制它的每一个特征。如果你这样做，有些人会让你感到可笑。例如，如果你是18岁，就不要抄袭一位50岁的知名教授的方式，也不要抄袭几百年后文艺复兴时期的诗歌的成语。

Some of the features of things you admire are flaws they succeeded despite. Indeed, the features that are easiest to imitate are the most likely to be the flaws.

  

你所欣赏的事物的一些特征是它们成功的缺陷。事实上，最容易模仿的特征最可能是缺陷。

This is particularly true for behavior. Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn't; being talented is merely how they get away with it.

  

对于行为来说，这一点尤其正确。一些有才华的人是混蛋，这有时会让没有经验的人觉得，做一个混蛋是有才华的一部分。其实不然；有才华只不过是他们如何逃脱的问题。

One of the most powerful kinds of copying is to copy something from one field into another. History is so full of chance discoveries of this type that it's probably worth giving chance a hand by deliberately learning about other kinds of work. You can take ideas from quite distant fields if you let them be metaphors.

  

最有力的一种复制是把一个领域的东西复制到另一个领域。历史上充满了这种类型的偶然发现，所以也许值得通过刻意学习其他种类的工作来给机会以帮助。如果你让它们成为隐喻，你可以从相当遥远的领域中获取想法。

Negative examples can be as inspiring as positive ones. In fact you can sometimes learn more from things done badly than from things done well; sometimes it only becomes clear what's needed when it's missing.

  

负面的例子可以和正面的例子一样具有启发性。事实上，你有时可以从做得不好的事情中学习到更多的东西，而不是从做得好的事情中学习到更多的东西；有时只有在缺少什么的时候才会清楚需要什么。

If a lot of the best people in your field are collected in one place, it's usually a good idea to visit for a while. It will increase your ambition, and also, by showing you that these people are human, increase your self-confidence.

\[[26](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f26n)\]  

如果在你的领域有很多最优秀的人聚集在一个地方，通常是一个好主意，可以去参观一段时间。这将增加你的雄心壮志，同时，通过向你展示这些人是人，增加你的自信心。\[26\]

If you're earnest you'll probably get a warmer welcome than you might expect. Most people who are very good at something are happy to talk about it with anyone who's genuinely interested. If they're really good at their work, then they probably have a hobbyist's interest in it, and hobbyists always want to talk about their hobbies.

  

如果你是认真的，你可能会得到比你预期更热烈的欢迎。大多数在某方面非常出色的人都很乐意与任何真正感兴趣的人谈论它。如果他们真的很擅长他们的工作，那么他们可能对它有兴趣，而兴趣者总是想谈论他们的爱好。

It may take some effort to find the people who are really good, though. Doing great work has such prestige that in some places, particularly universities, there's a polite fiction that everyone is engaged in it. And that is far from true. People within universities can't say so openly, but the quality of the work being done in different departments varies immensely. Some departments have people doing great work; others have in the past; others never have.

  

不过，要找到真正优秀的人，可能需要一些努力。做伟大的工作有这样的声望，在一些地方，特别是大学，有一种礼貌的虚构，认为每个人都在从事这项工作。而事实远非如此。大学里的人不能公开这么说，但不同部门所做工作的质量有很大的不同。有些部门有人在做伟大的工作；有些部门在过去有；有些部门从来没有。

Seek out the best colleagues. There are a lot of projects that can't be done alone, and even if you're working on one that can be, it's good to have other people to encourage you and to bounce ideas off.

  

寻找最好的同事。有很多项目是不能单独完成的，即使你正在做一个可以完成的项目，有其他人鼓励你并提出想法也是好事。

Colleagues don't just affect your work, though; they also affect you. So work with people you want to become like, because you will.

  

不过，同事不只是影响你的工作；他们也影响你。因此，与你想成为的人一起工作，因为你会成为的。

Quality is more important than quantity in colleagues. It's better to have one or two great ones than a building full of pretty good ones. In fact it's not merely better, but necessary, judging from history: the degree to which great work happens in clusters suggests that one's colleagues often make the difference between doing great work and not.

  

在同事中，质量比数量更重要。有一两个伟大的同事比一栋楼里都是相当好的同事要好。事实上，从历史上看，这不仅是更好的，而且是必要的：伟大的工作在集群中发生的程度表明，一个人的同事往往是做伟大工作与否的关键。

How do you know when you have sufficiently good colleagues? In my experience, when you do, you know. Which means if you're unsure, you probably don't. But it may be possible to give a more concrete answer than that. Here's an attempt: sufficiently good colleagues offer _surprising_ insights. They can see and do things that you can't. So if you have a handful of colleagues good enough to keep you on your toes in this sense, you're probably over the threshold.

  

你怎么知道你有足够好的同事？根据我的经验，当你知道时，你就知道了。这意味着如果你不确定，你可能不确定。但也许可以给出一个比这更具体的答案。这里有一个尝试：足够好的同事能提供令人惊讶的洞察力。他们能看到和做到你所看不到的东西。因此，如果你有少数几个足够好的同事，在这个意义上让你保持警惕，你可能已经超过了门槛。

Most of us can benefit from collaborating with colleagues, but some projects require people on a larger scale, and starting one of those is not for everyone. If you want to run a project like that, you'll have to become a manager, and managing well takes aptitude and interest like any other kind of work. If you don't have them, there is no middle path: you must either force yourself to learn management as a second language, or avoid such projects.

\[[27](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f27n)\]  

我们大多数人都能从与同事的合作中受益，但有些项目需要更大规模的人，而开始一个这样的项目并不适合所有人。如果你想管理这样的项目，你就必须成为一名管理者，而做好管理需要能力和兴趣，就像其他种类的工作一样。如果你不具备这些条件，就没有中间道路：你必须强迫自己把管理作为第二语言来学习，或者避免这种项目。\[27\]

Husband your morale. It's the basis of everything when you're working on ambitious projects. You have to nurture and protect it like a living organism.

  

丈夫你的士气。当你在从事雄心勃勃的项目时，它是一切的基础。你必须像一个活的有机体一样培养和保护它。

Morale starts with your view of life. You're more likely to do great work if you're an optimist, and more likely to if you think of yourself as lucky than if you think of yourself as a victim.

  

士气始于你对生活的看法。如果你是一个乐观主义者，你就更有可能做伟大的工作，如果你认为自己是幸运的，就比认为自己是受害者更有可能。

Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that's pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it's a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history.

  

的确，工作在某种程度上可以保护你远离问题。如果你选择的工作是纯粹的，它的困难就会成为逃避日常生活困难的避难所。如果这是逃避现实，这是一种非常有成效的形式，而且是历史上一些最伟大的人物所使用的形式。

Morale compounds via work: high morale helps you do good work, which increases your morale and helps you do even better work. But this cycle also operates in the other direction: if you're not doing good work, that can demoralize you and make it even harder to. Since it matters so much for this cycle to be running in the right direction, it can be a good idea to switch to easier work when you're stuck, just so you start to get something done.

  

士气通过工作而复合：高士气帮助你做好工作，而工作又提高你的士气，帮助你做更好的工作。但是，这个循环也在另一个方向运作：如果你没有做好工作，就会使你士气低落，使你更难做好工作。由于这个循环在正确的方向上运行非常重要，所以当你被卡住时，切换到更容易的工作是一个好主意，这样你就可以开始做一些事情了。

One of the biggest mistakes ambitious people make is to allow setbacks to destroy their morale all at once, like a ballon bursting. You can inoculate yourself against this by explicitly considering setbacks a part of your process. Solving hard problems always involves some backtracking.

  

有雄心壮志的人犯的最大错误之一是让挫折一下子摧毁他们的士气，就像气球爆裂一样。你可以通过明确地将挫折视为过程的一部分来防止这种情况的发生。解决困难的问题总是涉及到一些退路。

Doing great work is a depth-first search whose root node is the desire to. So "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again" isn't quite right. It should be: If at first you don't succeed, either try again, or backtrack and then try again.

  

做伟大的工作是一个深度优先的搜索，其根节点是欲望。因此，"如果一开始没有成功，那就试试，再试试 "并不完全正确。它应该是：如果一开始你没有成功，要么再试一次，要么回溯，然后再试一次。

"Never give up" is also not quite right. Obviously there are times when it's the right choice to eject. A more precise version would be: Never let setbacks panic you into backtracking more than you need to. Corollary: Never abandon the root node.

  

"永不放弃 "也不完全正确。显然，有些时候，弹出是正确的选择。一个更准确的版本应该是：绝不要让挫折使你惊慌失措地走回头路，比你需要的更多。推论：永远不要放弃根节点。

It's not necessarily a bad sign if work is a struggle, any more than it's a bad sign to be out of breath while running. It depends how fast you're running. So learn to distinguish good pain from bad. Good pain is a sign of effort; bad pain is a sign of damage.

  

如果工作很吃力，这不一定是个坏兆头，就像跑步时喘不过气来是个坏兆头一样。这取决于你跑得有多快。所以要学会区分好的疼痛和坏的疼痛。好的疼痛是努力的标志；坏的疼痛是损害的标志。

An audience is a critical component of morale. If you're a scholar, your audience may be your peers; in the arts, it may be an audience in the traditional sense. Either way it doesn't need to be big. The value of an audience doesn't grow anything like linearly with its size. Which is bad news if you're famous, but good news if you're just starting out, because it means a small but dedicated audience can be enough to sustain you. If a handful of people genuinely love what you're doing, that's enough.

  

听众是士气的一个重要组成部分。如果你是一个学者，你的听众可能是你的同行；在艺术领域，它可能是传统意义上的听众。无论哪种方式，它都不需要很大。听众的价值并不随着其规模的增长而线性增长。如果你已经成名，这是个坏消息，但如果你刚刚起步，则是个好消息，因为这意味着一个小而专注的观众就足以支撑你。如果有一小部分人真正喜欢你所做的事情，那就足够了。

To the extent you can, avoid letting intermediaries come between you and your audience. In some types of work this is inevitable, but it's so liberating to escape it that you might be better off switching to an adjacent type if that will let you go direct.

\[[28](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f28n)\]  

在你能做到的范围内，避免让中间人出现在你和你的观众之间。在某些类型的工作中，这是不可避免的，但摆脱它是如此的自由，以至于你可能会更好地转到一个相邻的类型，如果那会让你去直接。\[28\]

The people you spend time with will also have a big effect on your morale. You'll find there are some who increase your energy and others who decrease it, and the effect someone has is not always what you'd expect. Seek out the people who increase your energy and avoid those who decrease it. Though of course if there's someone you need to take care of, that takes precedence.

  

与你相处的人也会对你的士气有很大影响。你会发现有些人可以增加你的能量，有些人则会减少你的能量，而某人的影响并不总是你所期望的。寻找那些增加你能量的人，避免那些减少你能量的人。当然，如果有你需要照顾的人，那是优先考虑的。

Don't marry someone who doesn't understand that you need to work, or sees your work as competition for your attention. If you're ambitious, you need to work; it's almost like a medical condition; so someone who won't let you work either doesn't understand you, or does and doesn't care.

  

不要嫁给一个不理解你需要工作的人，或者把你的工作视为对你注意力的竞争。如果你有雄心壮志，你就需要工作；这几乎是一种医疗条件；所以不让你工作的人要么不理解你，要么理解你但不关心。

Ultimately morale is physical. You think with your body, so it's important to take care of it. That means exercising regularly, eating and sleeping well, and avoiding the more dangerous kinds of drugs. Running and walking are particularly good forms of exercise because they're good for thinking.

\[[29](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html#f29n)\]  

归根结底，士气就是身体。你用你的身体思考，所以照顾好你的身体很重要。这意味着要定期锻炼，吃好睡好，并避免使用更危险的药物。跑步和散步是特别好的锻炼方式，因为它们对思考有好处。\[29\]

People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they're happier than they'd be if they didn't. In fact, if you're smart and ambitious, it's dangerous _not_ to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don't achieve much tend to become bitter.

  

做伟大工作的人不一定比其他人更快乐，但他们比不做工作的人更快乐。事实上，如果你很聪明，有雄心壮志，不做出成绩是很危险的。聪明且有雄心壮志但却没有什么成就的人往往会变得很痛苦。

It's ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise.

  

想给别人留下好印象是可以的，但要选择正确的人。你尊重的人的意见是信号。名声，是一个更大的群体的意见，你可能会或可能不会尊重，只是增加噪音。

The prestige of a type of work is at best a trailing indicator and sometimes completely mistaken. If you do anything well enough, you'll make it prestigious. So the question to ask about a type of work is not how much prestige it has, but how well it could be done.

  

一类工作的声望充其量是一个跟踪指标，有时是完全错误的。如果你把任何事情做得足够好，你就会使它有声望。因此，关于一种工作类型要问的问题不是它有多少威望，而是它能做得多好。

Competition can be an effective motivator, but don't let it choose the problem for you; don't let yourself get drawn into chasing something just because others are. In fact, don't let competitors make you do anything much more specific than work harder.

  

竞争可以是一个有效的激励因素，但不要让它为你选择问题；不要让自己被吸引去追逐一些东西，只是因为其他人在追逐。事实上，不要让竞争对手让你做任何比努力工作更具体的事情。

Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to.

  

好奇心是最好的向导。你的好奇心从不说谎，而且它比你更了解什么是值得关注的。

Notice how often that word has come up. If you asked an oracle the secret to doing great work and the oracle replied with a single word, my bet would be on "curiosity."

  

注意这个词出现的频率。如果你问一个神谕者做伟大工作的秘诀，神谕者用一个词来回答，我打赌会是 "好奇心"。

That doesn't translate directly to advice. It's not enough just to be curious, and you can't command curiosity anyway. But you can nurture it and let it drive you.

  

这并不能直接转化为建议。仅仅有好奇心是不够的，而且无论如何你都无法指挥好奇心。但你可以培养它，让它推动你。

Curiosity is the key to all four steps in doing great work: it will choose the field for you, get you to the frontier, cause you to notice the gaps in it, and drive you to explore them. The whole process is a kind of dance with curiosity.

  

好奇心是做伟大工作的所有四个步骤的关键：它将为你选择领域，让你进入前沿，使你注意到其中的差距，并推动你去探索它们。整个过程是一种与好奇心共舞的过程。

Believe it or not, I tried to make this essay as short as I could. But its length at least means it acts as a filter. If you made it this far, you must be interested in doing great work. And if so you're already further along than you might realize, because the set of people willing to want to is small.

  

信不信由你，我试图使这篇文章尽可能地短。但它的长度至少意味着它起到了过滤作用。如果你能走到这一步，你一定对做伟大的工作感兴趣。如果是这样，你已经比你可能意识到的更进一步了，因为愿意想做的人的集合是很小的。

The factors in doing great work are factors in the literal, mathematical sense, and they are: ability, interest, effort, and luck. Luck by definition you can't do anything about, so we can ignore that. And we can assume effort, if you do in fact want to do great work. So the problem boils down to ability and interest. Can you find a kind of work where your ability and interest will combine to yield an explosion of new ideas?

  

做好工作的因素是字面上的、数学意义上的因素，它们是：能力、兴趣、努力和运气。运气的定义是你不能做任何事情，所以我们可以忽略它。我们可以假设努力，如果你确实想做伟大的工作。因此，问题可以归结为能力和兴趣。你能找到一种工作，让你的能力和兴趣结合起来，产生爆炸性的新想法吗？

Here there are grounds for optimism. There are so many different ways to do great work, and even more that are still undiscovered. Out of all those different types of work, the one you're most suited for is probably a pretty close match. Probably a comically close match. It's just a question of finding it, and how far into it your ability and interest can take you. And you can only answer that by trying.

  

在这里，我们有理由感到乐观。有这么多不同的方式来做伟大的工作，甚至有更多的方式仍未被发现。在所有这些不同类型的工作中，你最适合的工作可能是一个相当接近的匹配。可能是非常接近的匹配。这只是一个找到它的问题，以及你的能力和兴趣能带你走多远。而你只能通过尝试来回答这个问题。

Many more people could try to do great work than do. What holds them back is a combination of modesty and fear. It seems presumptuous to try to be Newton or Shakespeare. It also seems hard; surely if you tried something like that, you'd fail. Presumably the calculation is rarely explicit. Few people consciously decide not to try to do great work. But that's what's going on subconsciously; they shy away from the question.

  

许多人可以尝试做伟大的工作，而不是做。阻碍他们的是谦虚和恐惧的结合。试图成为牛顿或莎士比亚似乎很自以为是。它也似乎很难；如果你尝试这样的事情，你肯定会失败。据推测，这种计算很少是明确的。很少有人有意识地决定不尝试做伟大的工作。但这就是潜意识中的事情；他们对这个问题避而不谈。

So I'm going to pull a sneaky trick on you. Do you want to do great work, or not? Now you have to decide consciously. Sorry about that. I wouldn't have done it to a general audience. But we already know you're interested.

  

因此，我将对你施展一个偷偷摸摸的把戏。你是想做伟大的工作，还是不想？现在你必须有意识地决定。这一点很抱歉。我不会对普通观众这么做的。但我们已经知道你有兴趣。

Don't worry about being presumptuous. You don't have to tell anyone. And if it's too hard and you fail, so what? Lots of people have worse problems than that. In fact you'll be lucky if it's the worst problem you have.

  

不要担心自以为是的问题。你不需要告诉任何人。如果它太难了，你失败了，那又怎样？很多人都有比这更糟糕的问题。事实上，如果这是你遇到的最糟糕的问题，你会很幸运。

Yes, you'll have to work hard. But again, lots of people have to work hard. And if you're working on something you find very interesting, which you necessarily will if you're on the right path, the work will probably feel less burdensome than a lot of your peers'.

  

是的，你将不得不努力工作。但同样，很多人都必须努力工作。如果你从事的是你认为非常有趣的工作，而如果你走的是正确的道路，你一定会这样做，那么工作可能会比你的许多同龄人感觉不那么沉重。

The discoveries are out there, waiting to me made. Why not by you?

  

发现就在那里，等着我去做。为什么不由你来做呢？

**Notes  

笔记**

\[

1\] I don't think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.  

\[1\] 我不认为你可以给什么是伟大的工作下一个准确的定义。做伟大的工作意味着把重要的事情做得很好，以至于你扩大了人们对可能性的想法。但重要性没有门槛。这是一个程度问题，而且在当时往往很难判断。所以我宁愿人们专注于发展他们的兴趣，而不是担心他们是否重要。只要努力做一些令人惊奇的事情，留给后人去说你是否成功了。

\[

2\] A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in everyday life. "Did you ever notice...?" New ideas come from doing this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!  

\[2\]很多相声都是基于注意到日常生活中的反常现象。"你有没有注意到......"？新的想法来自于对非微不足道的事情做这些。这可能有助于解释为什么人们对一个新想法的反应往往是笑的前半部分：哈!

\[

3\] That second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about something most authorities discount, but you can't give a more precise explanation than "they don't get it," then you're starting to drift into the territory of cranks.  

\[3\] 第二个修饰语很关键。如果你对大多数权威人士都不看好的东西感到兴奋，但你不能给出比 "他们不懂 "更准确的解释，那么你就开始进入怪胎的领域了。

\[

4\] Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match between the current version of you and a list of known problems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The search space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible future versions of you.  

\[4\]寻找可以工作的东西并不是简单地在当前版本的你和已知问题的清单之间找到一个匹配。你往往要与问题共同发展。这就是为什么有时会很难弄清楚要做什么工作。搜索空间是巨大的。它是所有可能的工作类型，包括已知的和尚未发现的，以及所有可能的未来版本的你的笛卡尔积。

There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be; different types of work have been collected together as much by accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.

  

你不可能搜索整个空间，所以你必须依靠启发式方法来生成有希望的路径，并希望最佳匹配会被集中起来。它们并不总是如此；不同类型的作品被收集在一起，既是由于历史的偶然性，也是由于它们之间内在的相似性。

\[

5\] There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the first place.  

\[5\] 好奇的人更有可能完成伟大的工作，有很多原因，但其中一个更微妙的原因是，通过广撒网，他们更有可能首先找到合适的工作。

\[

6\] It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it in a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work. Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.  

\[6\]为你觉得不如你成熟的观众做东西也是危险的，如果这导致你对他们说三道四。如果你以一种足够愤世嫉俗的方式来做，你可以赚很多钱，但这并不是通往伟大作品的途径。不是说任何使用这种方法的人都会在乎。

\[

7\] This idea I learned from Hardy's _A Mathematician's Apology_, which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any field.  

\[7\] 这个想法是我从哈代的《数学家的道歉》中学到的，我把它推荐给任何有志于做伟大工作的人，在任何领域都是如此。

\[

8\] Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several years.  

\[8\] 正如我们高估了自己一天能做的事，而低估了自己几年能做的事一样，我们高估了拖延一天所造成的损害，而低估了拖延几年所造成的损害。

\[

9\] You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it.  

\[9\] 你通常不能因为做你想做的事情而得到报酬，特别是在早期。有两种选择：通过做接近你想要的工作来获得报酬，并希望将其推近；或者通过做完全不同的事情来获得报酬，并在旁边做你自己的项目。这两种方法都能奏效，但都有缺点：在第一种方法中，你的工作被默认为受到影响，而在第二种方法中，你必须争取时间来做这些工作。

\[

10\] If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and that you walk to and from.  

\[10\] 如果你的生活设置正确，它将自动提供专注-放松的循环。完美的设置是一个你工作的办公室，你可以步行往返。

\[

11\] There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to cover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the best.  

\[11\]可能有一些非常不谙世事的人，他们不自觉地做着伟大的工作。如果你想扩大这条规则以涵盖这种情况，它就变成了：除了最好的，不要试图成为任何东西。

\[

12\] This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid _unintentional_ affectation.  

\[12\] 这在像表演这样的工作中会变得更加复杂，在那里，目标是采用一个假的角色。但即使在这里，也有可能被影响。也许在这种领域的规则应该是避免无意的影响。

\[

13\] It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under the law, because a sentence with a "should" in it isn't really a statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve it.  

\[13\]当且仅当这些信念也是不可证伪的时候，拥有被你视为不可质疑的信念是安全的。例如，拥有 "法律面前人人平等 "的原则是安全的，因为一个带有 "应该 "的句子并不是对世界的真正陈述，因此很难被推翻。而且，如果没有证据可以推翻你的一个原则，就不可能有任何你需要忽略的事实来维护它。

\[

14\] Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.  

\[14\] 情感化比智力不诚实更容易治愈。情绪化往往是年轻人的缺点，随着时间的推移会逐渐消失，而智力上的不诚实则更像是一种性格缺陷。

\[

15\] Obviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment you have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly recently.  

\[15\] 显然，你不必在你有这个想法的确切时刻工作，但你可能最近一直在工作。

\[

16\] Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.  

\[16\] 有人说精神活性药物也有类似的效果。我持怀疑态度，但也几乎完全不了解它们的效果。

\[

17\] For example you might give the nth most important topic (m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1. You couldn't allocate your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an idea of a reasonable distribution.  

\[17\]例如，你可以给第n个最重要的话题以(m-1)/m^n的注意力，对于某些m&gt;1。

\[

18\] The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.  

\[18\] 界定一个宗教的原则必须是错误的。否则，任何人都可以采用这些原则，而没有任何东西可以将宗教的信徒与其他人区分开来。

\[

19\] It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're now in a position to do something about some of them.  

\[19\] 尝试写下你年轻时想知道的问题清单可能是一个好的练习。你可能会发现你现在有能力为其中一些问题做些什么。

\[

20\] The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand in disputes, even though they're generally stupider.  

\[20\] 原创性和不确定性之间的联系造成了一个奇怪的现象：因为思想传统的人比思想独立的人更有把握，这往往会使他们在争端中占上风，尽管他们一般都比较愚蠢。

\[21\] Derived from Linus Pauling's "If you want to have good ideas, you must have many ideas."  

\[21\] 源于莱纳斯-鲍林的 "如果你想有好的想法，你必须有很多想法"。

\[

22\] Attacking a project as a "toy" is similar to attacking a statement as "inappropriate." It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to stick.  

\[22\] 攻击一个项目为 "玩具 "类似于攻击一个声明为 "不恰当"。这意味着不能让更多实质性的批评坚持下去。

\[

23\] One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don't.  

\[23\] 判断你是否在浪费时间的一个方法是问你是在生产还是消费。写电脑游戏比玩电脑游戏更不可能是浪费时间，而玩你创造的游戏比玩你不创造的游戏更不可能是浪费时间。

\[

24\] Another related advantage is that if you haven't said anything publicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people, having previously published opinions has an effect similar to ideology, just in quantity 1.  

\[24\] 另一个相关的优势是，如果你还没有公开说过什么，你就不会对支持你早期结论的证据产生偏见。如果有足够的诚信，你可以在这方面获得永恒的青春，但很少有人能做到。对于大多数人来说，以前发表过的意见具有类似于意识形态的效果，只是数量上的1。

\[

25\] In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted his own version to show how much better he was.  

\[25\] 1630年代初，丹尼尔-迈腾斯画了一幅亨丽埃塔-玛丽亚向查理一世递送月桂花环的画，然后凡-戴克画了自己的版本，以显示他有多好。

\[

26\] I'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that are hard to duplicate, but that could change.  

\[26\]对于什么是地方，我故意说得很模糊。截至本文写作时，在同一物理场所具有难以复制的优势，但这可能会改变。

\[

27\] This is false when the work the other people have to do is very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible to expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.  

\[27\] 当其他人要做的工作非常受限制时，这就是假的，比如SETI@home或比特币。也许可以通过定义类似的限制性协议，在节点上有更多的行动自由，来扩大它是错误的领域。

\[

28\] Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably a good idea.  

\[28\] 推论：建立一些能够让人们绕过中介机构直接与受众接触的东西可能是一个好主意。

\[

29\] It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and there is some historical evidence for it.  

\[29\]总是走或跑同样的路线可能是有帮助的，因为这样可以把注意力释放出来进行思考。我觉得是这样，而且有一些历史证据证明了这一点。**Thanks** to Trevor Blackwell, Daniel Gackle, Pam Graham, Tom Howard, Patrick Hsu, Steve Huffman, Jessica Livingston, Henry Lloyd-Baker, Bob Metcalfe, Ben Miller, Robert Morris, Michael Neilsen, Courtenay Pipkin, Joris Poort, Mieke Roos, Rajat Suri, Harj Taggar, Garry Tan, and my younger son for suggestions and for reading drafts.
