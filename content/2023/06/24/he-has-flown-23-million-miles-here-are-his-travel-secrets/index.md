So you’re going to fly this summer? Europe, maybe? And you’re dreading flying the way cats hate baths?  

那么你今年夏天要飞吗？欧洲，也许？而你害怕飞行，就像猫讨厌洗澡一样？

Well, you need to talk to the man who’s [flown more miles](https://simpleflying.com/tom-stuker-frequent-flyer-story/#:~:text=After%20having%20flown%20all%20over,miles%20on%20over%2012%2C000%20flights.) than any human being in history — 23 million so far, or [22 million more than Apollo 11](https://www.britannica.com/story/timeline-of-the-apollo-space-missions#:~:text=The%20three%20astronauts%20on%20Apollo%2011%20were%20Neil%20Armstrong%2C%20Edwin,a%20total%20of%20953%2C054%20miles.).  

好吧，你需要和这个人谈谈，他比历史上任何一个人的飞行里程都要多--到目前为止有2300万英里，比阿波罗11号多了2200万英里。

His name is Tom Stuker — a 69-year-old New Jersey car dealership consultant — and he’s the biggest mistake United Airlines ever made.  

他的名字叫汤姆-斯图克（Tom Stuker）--一位69岁的新泽西州汽车经销商顾问--他是美国联合航空公司有史以来犯下的最大错误。

In 1990, United offered a lifetime pass for $290,000. Stuker jumped on it and has pretty much lived in seat 1B — his favorite — ever since. He once went 12 straight days without sleeping in a bed. Just kept jetting from Newark to San Francisco to Bangkok to Dubai and back again, the equivalent of four trips around the world, leaving the sky only for the airport lounge.  

1990年，美联航提供了一张价值29万美元的终身票。斯图克抓住了这个机会，从那时起，他几乎一直住在他最喜欢的1B座位上。他曾经连续12天没有睡过床。他不断地从纽瓦克到旧金山到曼谷到迪拜，再回来，相当于四次环游世界，只把天空留给机场休息室。

Why? _Duh._ For the miles. “Best investment of my life,” Stuker says. He realized that frequent-flier miles aren’t just valuable for booking more flights. Once you get them, you can sell them, trade them, win auctions with them. Stuker has lived like a sultan on United miles ever since — lavish hotel suites all over the world, weeks-long Crystal cruises, gourmet meals from Perth to Paris.  

为什么？是的。因为里程数。"我一生中最好的投资，"斯图克说。他意识到，常旅客里程不仅对预订更多航班有价值。一旦你得到它们，你可以出售它们，交易它们，用它们赢得拍卖。从那时起，斯图克就像一个依靠美联航里程的苏丹一样生活--世界各地的豪华酒店套房，长达数周的水晶游轮，从珀斯到巴黎的美食佳肴。

He says he even parlayed the miles into enough gift cards to redo his brother’s house. The miles maestro once cashed $50,000 worth of Walmart gift cards in a single day. United quit offering the passes a long time ago, so don’t get any ideas.  

他说，他甚至把这些里程数换成了足够的礼品卡来重新装修他哥哥的房子。这位里程大师曾经在一天之内兑现了价值5万美元的沃尔玛礼品卡。美联航很久以前就不提供这种通行证了，所以不要有任何想法。

Get this — years ago he won a charity auction by bidding 451,000 miles to be on a “Seinfeld” episode. (The one where [George’s fiancée dies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP2aVdA-oIQ) from licking envelopes. Stuker’s in the diner.)  

了解到这一点--多年前，他通过出价451,000英里在 "宋飞 "一集的慈善拍卖会上获胜。(乔治的未婚妻因舔信封而死的那一集。斯图克在餐厅里）。

He has seen more than 100 countries. He figures that he and his very happy wife have been on more than 120 honeymoons. He has played United like three-card monte, and there’s been nothing they can do to stop him.  

他已经看过100多个国家。他估计，他和他非常幸福的妻子已经去过120多次蜜月了。他把美联航当做三张牌来玩，而他们一直没有办法阻止他。

But it’s the weirdest thing. Sometimes hostages love their captors, and [United loves their loss leader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOc51dw9flM). Over the years, the airline has put his name on not one but two planes. _Thomas R. Stuker, Customer._ They let him help design the menu at their new Polaris clubs. He says that when he has a tight connection, there’s a Mercedes waiting on the tarmac to whoosh him to the next gate.  

但这是最奇怪的事情。有时候，人质喜欢他们的绑架者，而美联航喜欢他们的损失领导者。多年来，该航空公司将他的名字写在不止一架而是两架飞机上。托马斯-R-斯图克，客户。他们让他帮助设计新的北极星俱乐部的菜单。他说，当他有一个紧张的连接时，有一辆奔驰车在停机坪上等着把他送到下一个门。

Any airline ever do that for you?  

有哪家航空公司为你做过这样的事？

I flew with him from Newark to Los Angeles once just to see it all for myself. Tom Stuker doesn’t do airlines like you and I do airlines. When he calls the 800 number, they go, “Mr. Stuker? Is that you?” Ropes come down, doors fly open and free champagne bottles end up in his bag. You know how the gold-diamond-platinum-level-customers-way-better-than-you board planes first? Tom Stuker has already been sitting in 1B and eating nuts from little porcelain cups for 10 minutes before they even get called.  

我曾经和他一起从纽瓦克飞往洛杉矶，就是为了亲眼看看这一切。汤姆-斯图克不像你和我那样做航空公司。当他拨打800电话时，他们会说："斯图克先生？是你吗？"绳子下来了，门飞快地打开了，免费的香槟酒瓶最终出现在他的包里。你知道那些比你优秀的金钻铂金级客户是如何先上飞机的吗？在他们被叫到之前，汤姆-斯图克已经坐在1B，用小瓷杯吃了10分钟的坚果。

He has taken thousands and thousands of United flights, so I just had to ask …  

他乘坐过成千上万的美联航航班，所以我不得不问......。

_Anybody ever die up there with you?  

有没有人和你一起死在上面？_

“Four,” Stuker says. "四，"斯图克说。

_Four? 四个？_

_“_Yeah, four. All heart attacks. I’d met a couple of them, too. Just died right in their seats. The last guy was up in business with me, Chicago to Narita \[Tokyo\]. They covered him with a blanket and put the seat belt back on. What else could they do? I guarantee somebody in business was thinking, ‘Hey, if he’s not gonna eat his chocolate sundae, would you mind … ?”  

"是的，四个。都是心脏病发作。我也见过他们中的几个人。就这样死在他们的座位上。最后一个人是和我一起出差的，从芝加哥到成田\[东京\]。他们给他盖上毯子，然后重新系上安全带。他们还能做什么？我敢保证，在业务上有人在想，"嘿，如果他不打算吃他的巧克力圣代，你会介意......"。

So what advice does the Very Frequent Flier have for you this summer?  

那么，今年夏天，非常常旅客对你有什么建议呢？

1.  Lie to the first flight attendant you meet inside the door when you board. “She’s the head attendant. I always say, ‘I remember you! You gave us such great service last time. I wanted to thank you again.’ Even if I’ve never met her. I guarantee she’ll bring you all kinds of free stuff.”  
    
    在你登机时，对你在门内遇到的第一个空姐撒谎。"她是乘务长。我总是说，'我记得你！'！你上次给了我们这么好的服务。我想再次感谢你'。即使我从未见过她。我保证她会给你带来各种免费的东西。"
2.  If you couldn’t book the seat you wanted, keep your phone open on the seat map app as you board. If a blocked seat that you wanted opens up, just take it. “They won’t care,” he says. “They never sold it.”  
    
    如果你不能预订你想要的座位，在你登机时保持你的手机打开座位地图应用程序。如果有一个你想要的被挡住的座位出现了，就拿下它。"他们不会在意的，"他说。"他们从来没有卖过它。"
3.  Never check a bag. Never, ever, never. And under-pack. “Every town has laundromats. And stores.”  
    
    永远不要托运行李。绝不，永远，绝不。而且要少带行李。"每个城镇都有洗衣店。还有商店。"
4.  Don’t be a jerk and use your cell without headphones. That way, people won’t hate you. “Whenever somebody takes a long business call on speaker, I always say, ‘Hey, next time you’re going to have all of us to your business meeting, bring doughnuts.’”  
    
    不要做一个混蛋，不戴耳机就用手机。这样的话，人们就不会讨厌你。"每当有人用扬声器打了一个很长的商务电话，我总是说，'嘿，下次你要让我们所有人参加你的商务会议，请带甜甜圈。

My best travel advice? Get to know Tom Stuker. He has miles coming out of his attic windows, and he loves to upgrade his friends. Plus, Stuker’s miles will get you to No. 1 on any United upgrade list from today until the day he drops dead, hopefully not until after the sundae.  

我最好的旅行建议？认识一下汤姆-斯图克。他的里程数从他的阁楼窗户里冒出来，他喜欢给他的朋友升舱。此外，Stuker的里程数可以让你在任何美联航的升舱名单上排名第一，从今天起直到他死的那一天，希望不要在圣代之后。
