I've been in this business a long time; before I started my own product company
— "startup," if you must — in 2008, I spent a _decade_ building other people's.
And, believe me, I was always on Safari, always paying attention to what people
said and did and what worked and didn't. I was paying close attention during the
first dot-com crash even while I was personally unaffected.

我从事这一行已经有很长一段时间了；在 2008 年创办自己的产品公司（如果一定要叫
"初创公司 "的话）之前，我花了十年的时间来创建别人的公司。相信我，我一直都在关注
Safari，关注人们的一言一行，关注哪些行之有效，哪些行不通。在第一次网络公司崩盘时，我一直在密切关注，即使我本人并未受到影响。

Perhaps I haven't seen it _all_, but it's real close.

也许我还没看全，但已经很接近了。

That's why I've been saying that
[startup winter is coming](https://stackingthebricks.com/startup-winter-is-coming-and-it-can-fuck-up-bootstrappers/)
ever since this over-funded nonsense began.

这就是为什么从资金过剩的胡闹开始，我就一直在说初创企业的冬天就要来了。

Now here we are…

现在我们在这里...

Startup valuations have collapsed.

初创企业的估值已经崩溃。

VC funding is drying up.

风险投资资金正在枯竭。

Crypto is dead. (Inevitable.)

加密货币已死。(不可避免）。

The metaverse never lived at all. (Predictable.)

元宇宙根本就没有存在过。(可以预见）。

"AI" is an attempt to recapture the frenzy that crypto generated. But the
technology isn't there —
[actual artificial intelligence doesn't exist](https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/there-is-no-ai),
and while a fancy autocomplete does indeed have _some_ useful function, it's not
nearly as broadly applicable, usable, or trustworthy as they claim. Especially
not if you have professional standards. Like crypto, it's most useful for people
with bad intentions, as illustrated by the Hollywood dynamics in the first link
above.

"人工智能
"试图重新唤起人们对加密货币的狂热。但技术并不存在--真正的人工智能并不存在，虽然花哨的自动完成功能确实有一些有用的功能，但并不像他们所说的那样广泛适用、可用或可信。尤其是如果你有专业标准的话。就像加密货币一样，它对居心不良的人最有用，上面第一个链接中的好莱坞动态就说明了这一点。

Unlike crypto, AI can't inherently promise endless riches — you have to _work_
for it, you have to have some business to _apply_ it to — so it will never reach
the same heights.

与加密货币不同，人工智能本质上不能承诺无尽的财富--你必须为之努力，你必须有一些业务来应用它--因此它永远不会达到同样的高度。

Don't let yourself be tricked into feeling like you're "behind," or "missing
out" on these trends; the goal of both has always been to concentrate power and
fleece people, in that order. That's why the
[hype](https://fortune.com/2023/07/19/chatgpt-accuracy-stanford-study) is
[based](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/) on
[lies](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474).

不要让自己上当受骗，觉得自己 "落后 "或 "错过
"了这些趋势；这两种趋势的目标一直都是集中权力和欺骗人民，依次类推。这就是为什么炒作是建立在谎言之上的。

Nearly the entire "tech" environment we've been swimming in since ~2010 has been
a zero-interest-rate phenomenon, and propped up by historic levels of wealth
concentration with nowhere else to go.

自 2010 年以来，我们所处的整个 "科技
"环境几乎都是零利率现象，并由无处可去的历史性财富集中度支撑着。

That last part is crucial: _Historic levels of wealth concentration with nowhere
else to go_.

最后一部分至关重要：财富集中程度达到历史最高水平，无处可去。

Rich people and institutions needed a place where their money could make more
money… because they were too bored for index funds, and full up on real estate,
yet they didn't know _how to make things._ They had to cast about to find things
to buy into.

有钱人和机构需要一个能让他们的钱赚更多钱的地方......因为他们对指数基金太厌烦了，满脑子都是房地产，却不知道如何制造东西。他们不得不四处寻找可以购买的东西。

They trusted the people who claimed they _did_ know how to make things.

他们相信那些声称自己确实知道如何制造东西的人。

Those people — the venture capitalists, the starry-eyed startup founders —
talked a big talk and, while they might be able to "build" _things,_ they
figured making _money_ was a problem for another day; they could turn the hot &
cold running OPM (Other People's Money) tap any time they needed it. Except now
they can't.

那些人--风险资本家、满眼星光的初创企业创始人--高谈阔论，虽然他们可能有能力 "建造
"东西，但他们认为赚钱是后话，他们可以随时打开冷热运转的
OPM（其他人的钱）水龙头。但现在他们不能了。

_They didn't know how to make **profit**._ And now it's too late.

他们不知道如何盈利。现在为时已晚。

_(And, in case you've wondered, that's also why these companies have been
copycatting each other in such comically obvious ways… their northstar for
decision-making was never the business itself, the market, or the work. It was
always and ever only about the funding environment.)

(而且，如果你想知道，这也是为什么这些公司一直在以如此滑稽明显的方式相互抄袭的原因......他们决策的北斗星从来不是业务本身、市场或作品。他们始终只关心资金环境（the
funding environment)。_

That's why the end of the boom times doesn't matter for you or me, not in the
long run.

因此，从长远来看，繁荣期的结束对你我来说并不重要。

That's why I was unaffected by the first dot-com crash, and the following 2008
financial crisis…

这就是为什么我没有受到第一次网络崩溃和随后的 2008 年金融危机的影响......

_We can build things that people will pay real money to have and use.

我们可以制造人们愿意花大价钱购买和使用的东西。_

I'm not saying the psycho-economic environment doesn't affect sales, because it
sure can. And if your customers are mainly profit-free VC-funded startups, well,
some things are going to hurt.

我并不是说心理经济环境不会影响销售，因为它确实会。如果你的客户主要是无利润的风险投资初创企业，那么有些事情就会很糟糕。

But if you can figure out what paying customers need, want, & are ready to lay
out _actual cash_ to buy, and give it to them? It's _always_ good times.

但是，如果你能搞清楚付费客户需要什么、想要什么，并准备拿出现金来购买，然后给他们？这就是好时机。

The booms will never be as big, but neither will the crashes.

经济繁荣不会像现在这样，但经济崩溃也不会像现在这样。

So don't get caught up in FOMO.

所以，不要陷入 FOMO。

Bring it back to business fundamentals.

回归商业本质。

_Make things people want to pay for.

做人们愿意花钱买的东西。_

Build yourself a profit.

为自己创造利润。
